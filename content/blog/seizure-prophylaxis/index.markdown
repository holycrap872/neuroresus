Due to the risk of seizures in various neurological disease states, the use of seizure prophylaxis is a common yet controversial practice.

Incidence of seizures varies greatly, depending on the disease state, location affected, and interventions performed.

## Intracerebral Tumors

Seizures are common in this population. Can be the presenting symptom in 40% of patients, 20-45% develop seizures during the course of their disease [<sup>1</sup>](#ref-roweSeizureProphylaxisNeurocritical2014).

More likely in the setting primary brain tumor vs metastatic, low-grade vs high-grade glioma, and certain specific tumor types.

AAN practice parameter in 2000 concluded that seizure prophylaxis is not effective in these patients based on 12 studies (4 of which were randomized trials).

Many harms were found (as many as 42% of patients had some adverse effect).
