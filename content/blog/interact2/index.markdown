excerpt: 'INTERACT-2 was the first large, multicenter randomized trial to evaluate the effect of rapidly lowering blood pressure to a specific target in patients presenting with acute intracerebral hemorrhage within 6 hours of symptom onset. 2839 patients were randomized to achieve a blood pressure target of < 180 mm Hg (at that time, guideline-based treatment) or < 140 mm Hg (intensive blood pressure control).
</br></br>
At 90 days, 55.6% of patients in the guideline-recommended group were dead or severely disabled, compared to 52% of patients in the intensive-treatment group. This translated to an **OR 0.87 (95% CI 0.75 - 1.01)** in favor of the intensive-treatment group. This data is consistent with up to a 1% increase or a 25% decrease in the risk of death or major disability.'

## Background and Clinical Context

The onset of intracerebral hemorrhage is often accompanied by an acute hypertensive response, which can reach very high levels and is associated with hematoma expansion and poor outcome. Previous AHA/ASA Guidelines recommended maintaining an SBP \< 180 and/or a MAP \< 110 to best balance the risks of hematoma expansion and maintaining an adequate cerebral perfusion pressure. However, this was not based on any robust evidence as no high-quality observational studies or randomized trials had been conducted.

INTERACT-2 was the first randomized trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of early intensive lowering of blood pressure on clinical outcomes.

## Clinical Question

In patients presenting with acute primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) with a systolic blood pressure between 150-220 mm Hg, does lowering of blood pressure to a target SBP \< 140 mm Hg improve death or major disability at 90 days when compared to a target SBP \< 180 mm Hg?

## Patient Population

Patients were included if they presented with an ICH within 6 hours of onset and had an initial systolic blood pressure of 150-220 mm Hg. Patients were excluded if they had an admission GCS of 3-5, were perceived to have a poor prognosis, or if early hematoma evacuation was planned.

The mean age of the population was about 63 years, with 2/3 being male and 2/3 also being recruited from China.

Most patients had mild ICH: median GCS was 14 (IQR 12 - 15), median NIHSS was 10 (IQR 6 - 15) and median hematoma volume of 11 mL (IQR 6-19) with approximately one-third of bleeds having intraventricular extension and the vast majority with a deep hematoma location (83%). Only about 7% of patients were intubated and 3% of patients required an EVD.

## Study Protocol

**Intervention Group**: target a systolic blood pressure \< 140 mm Hg within 1 hour of randomization and maintain this level for 7 days. Specific BP-lowering treatments were left to the discretion of local clinicians.

**Control Group:** target a systolic blood pressure \< 180 mm Hg (based on 2007 AHA/ASA Guidelines)

**Management Common to Both Groups**: all patients were initiated on oral antihypertensives within 7 days of the index event with the long-term goal of achieving a systolic blood pressure \<140 mm Hg

Despite the fairly large difference in blood pressure targets, there wasn't much of a difference between the two groups when examining the mean achieved systolic blood pressure, as pictured below (figure taken from online supplement).

This may indicate that centers were already practicing more aggressive blood pressure control than the AHA guidelines had recommended, making it difficult to achieve separation between the two groups.

Examining the achieved blood pressure in the FAST trial, this seems likely the case.





## Results

**Primary Outcome**: death or major disability at 90 days as defined by modified Rankin score of 3-6

Things still to tweak:

-   Dotted lines in between bars to indicate the differences between various cutpoints on the mRS
-   Adding table on the bottom with odds ratios of primary outcome cutoff vs. other cutoffs?
-   Ultimately may be better to add a tabbed format to display p-value functions
