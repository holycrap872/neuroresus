# INTERACT-2 Visualization



First we have the plot for the mRS at 90 days.
Things still to tweak:

- Dotted lines in between bars to indicate the differences between various cutpoints on the mRS
- Adding table on the bottom with odds ratios of primary outcome cutoff vs. other cutoffs?
- Ultimately may be better to add a tabbed format to display p-value functions
