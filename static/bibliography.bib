  abstract = {Background: Pulmonary and critical care physicians routinely make complex decisions, but little is known about cognitive aspects of this process. Omission bias and status quo bias are well-descibed cognitive biases that can cause lay decision makers to prefer inaction that preserves the status quo even when changing the status quo through action is more likely to lead to the best outcomes. It is unknown if these biases influence trained decision makers such as pulmonologists. Study objectives: To determine whether omission bias and status quo bias influence the medical decisions of pulmonologists. Design and interventions: The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted within a cross-sectional survey of pulmonologists' opinions about the relevance of various factors in pulmonary and critical care decision making. We designed case vignettes that presented patient information with an associated patient management choice. The status quo state and the action/omission distinction were varied in two forms of otherwise identical vignettes. One form of each case vignette pair (A and B) was administered randomly to each prospective respondent during the first mailing of the opinion survey. Participants: Five hundred pulmonologists selected randomly from the membership of the American College of Chest Physicians. Measurements and results: There were 125 respondents, including 59 for form A and 66 form B (enrollment rate, 25\%). In vignettes involving evaluation of pulmonary embolism and treatment of septic shock, respondents were more likely to choose a suboptimal management strategy when an omission option was present that allowed preservation of the status quo (71\% vs 53\%, p ؍ 0.048; 50\% vs 29\%, p ؍ 0.016, respectively). In a vignette involving a hypothetical clinical trial and the decision to prescribe tube feeding, the omission option was not significantly associated with the decision to prescribe tube feeding (54\% vs 50\%, p ؍ 0.67). Conclusion: Pulmonary and critical care decisions are susceptible to the influence of omission and status quo bias. Because of the great number of decisions that are made each day involving choices between maintaining or changing the status quo, this finding could have far-reaching implications for patient outcomes, cost-effectiveness, resource utilization, clinical practice variability, and medical errors.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Mortality is the most widely accepted outcome measure in randomized controlled trials of therapies for critically ill adults, but most of these trials fail to show a statistically significant mortality benefit. The reasons for this are unknown. Methods: We searched five high impact journals (Annals of Internal Medicine, British Medical Journal, JAMA, The Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine) for randomized controlled trials comparing mortality of therapies for critically ill adults over a ten year period. We abstracted data on the statistical design and results of these trials to compare the predicted delta (delta; the effect size of the therapy compared to control expressed as an absolute mortality reduction) to the observed delta to determine if there is a systematic overestimation of predicted delta that might explain the high prevalence of negative results in these trials. Results: We found 38 trials meeting our inclusion criteria. Only 5/38 (13.2\%) of the trials provided justification for the predicted delta. The mean predicted delta among the 38 trials was 10.1\% and the mean observed delta was 1.4\% (P {$<$} 0.0001), resulting in a delta-gap of 8.7\%. In only 2/38 (5.3\%) of the trials did the observed delta exceed the predicted delta and only 7/38 (18.4\%) of the trials demonstrated statistically significant results in the hypothesized direction; these trials had smaller delta-gaps than the remainder of the trials (delta-gap 0.9\% versus 10.5\%; P {$<$} 0.0001). For trials showing non-significant trends toward benefit greater than 3\%, large increases in sample size (380\% - 1100\%) would be required if repeat trials use the observed delta from the index trial as the predicted delta for a follow-up study. Conclusions: Investigators of therapies for critical illness systematically overestimate treatment effect size (delta) during the design of randomized controlled trials. This bias, which we refer to as "delta inflation", is a potential reason that these trials have a high rate of negative results.},

The paper uses a qualitative approach to develop an explanation of this paradox using semi-structured interviews with 153 persons with disabilities. 54.3\% of the respondents with moderate to serious disabilities reported having an excellent or good quality of life con\textregistered rming the existence of the disability paradox. Analysis of the interviews reveals that for both those who report that they have a good and those who say they have a poor quality of life, quality of life is dependent upon \textregistered nding a balance between body, mind and spirit in the self and on establishing and maintaining an harmonious set of relationships within the person's social context and external environment. A theoretical framework is developed to express these relationships. The \textregistered ndings are discussed for those with and without disabilities and directions are given for future research. \# 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The panel comprised 20 international clinical experts from 12 countries, and 2 patient representatives. We adhered to the methodology for trustworthy clinical practice guidelines and followed a strict conflict of interest policy. We convened panelists through teleconferences and web-based discussions. Guideline experts from the guidelines in intensive care, development, and evaluation Group provided methodological support. Two content experts provided input and shared their expertise with the panel but did not participate in drafting the final recommendations. We fol-lowed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to assess the certainty of evidence and grade recommendations and suggestions. We used the evidence to decision framework to generate recommendations. The panel provided input on guideline implementation and monitoring, and suggested future research priorities. The overall certainty in the evidence was low. The ICM-RPG panel issued one recommendation and two suggestions regarding the use of NMBAs in adults with ARDS. Current evidence does not support the early rou-tine use of an NMBA infusion in adults with ARDS of any severity. It favours avoiding a continuous infusion of NMBA for patients who are ventilated using a lighter sedation strategy. However, for patients who require deep sedation to facilitate lung protective ventilation or prone positioning, and require neuromuscular blockade, an infusion of an NMBA for 48 h is a reasonable option.},

  abstract = {Background/Objective:\hspace{0.6em} Stress-related mucosal bleeding (SRMB) occurs in approximately 2\textendash 4\% of critically ill patients. Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) have a (diffuse) space-occupying lesion, are criti-cally ill, often require mechanical ventilation, and frequently receive anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy after aneu-rysm embolization, all of which may be risk factors for SRMB. However, no studies have evaluated SRMB in patients with aSAH. Aims of the study were to determine the incidence of SRMB in aSAH patients, evaluate the effect of acid suppression on SRMB, and identify specific risk factors for SRMB. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} This was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study conducted across 17 centers. Each center reviewed up to 50 of the most recent cases of aSAH. Patients with length of stay (LOS)\,{$<$}\,48 h or active GI bleeding on admission were excluded. Variables related to demographics, aSAH severity, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, provision of SRMB prophylaxis, adverse events, intensive care unit (ICU), and hospital LOS were collected for the first 21 days of admission or until hospital discharge, whichever came first. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. A multivariate logistic regression modeling was utilized to examine the relationship between specific risk factors and the incidence of clinically important GI bleeding in patients with aSAH. Results:\hspace{0.6em} A total of 627 patients were included. The overall incidence of clinically important GI bleeding was 4.9\%. Of the patients with clinically important GI bleeding, 19 (61\%) received pharmacologic prophylaxis prior to evidence of GI bleeding, while 12 (39\%) were not on pharmacologic prophylaxis at the onset of GI bleeding. Patients who received an acid suppressant agent were less likely to experience GI bleeding than patients who did not receive pharmaco-logic prophylaxis prior to evidence of bleeding (OR 0.39, 95\% CI 0.18\textendash 0.83). The multivariate regression analysis identi-fied any instance of elevated intracranial pressure, creatinine clearance\,{$<$}\,60 ml/min and the incidence of cerebral vasospasm as specific risk factors associated with GI bleeding. Cerebral vasospasm has not previously been described as a risk for GI bleeding (OR 2.5 95\% CI 1.09\textendash 5.79).},

Based on these needs, we tested the following step-down unit admission criteria: Supratentorial ICH, ICH volume {$<$}20 cc, no Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), systolic BP {$<$}200mmHg, no respiratory failure, GCS{$\geq$}12. We classified 431 patients into two groups; 1-Patients who met step-down unit admission Criteria (71 patients). 2-Patients who didn't meet the criteria (360 patients).ResultsIn our patients, 16.5\% fulfilled the criteria. Length of stay in the ICU was 1.43days in step-down unit admission criteria patients. None of the patients who fulfilled the criteria were readmitted to the ICU, compared to 3 readmissions among the group of patients who did not fulfill the criteria (P=0.82). None of these patients required a neurosurgical procedure vs 47 patients (10.9\%) in the other group (P=0.04). Among patients who met the criteria, 83.1\% were discharged home or rehab RR 0.33 CI (0.19\textendash 0.55), (P{$<$}0.0001).ConclusionWe propose that patients who fulfill step-down unit admission criteria can be safely monitored in stroke unit and they have no need for ICU admission. Further studies are needed to validate these criteria in a prospective manner.},

The primary outcome was defined as the composite of ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, symptomatic cerebral bleeding, and major extracerebral bleeding observed at 90 days after the acute stroke. Results\textemdash Of 1810 patients who initiated oral anticoagulant therapy, 371 (20\%) underwent bridging therapy with full-dose low-molecular-weight heparin. Older age and the presence of leukoaraiosis were inversely correlated with the use of bridging therapy. Forty-two bridged patients (11.3\%) reached the combined outcome versus 72 (5.0\%) of the nonbridged patients (P=0.0001). At multivariable analysis, bridging therapy was associated with the composite end point (odds ratio, 2.3; 95\% CI, 1.4\textendash 3.7; P{$<$}0.0001), as well as ischemic (odds ratio, 2.2; 95\% CI, 1.3\textendash 3.9; P=0.005) and hemorrhagic (odds ratio, 2.4; 95\% CI, 1.2\textendash 4.9; P=0.01) end points separately. Conclusions\textemdash Our findings suggest that patients receiving low-molecular-weight heparin have a higher risk of early ischemic recurrence and hemorrhagic transformation compared with nonbridged patients.\hspace{0.6em}\,{$\mkern1mu$}(Stroke. 2019;50:2093-2100.

  abstract = {Prognostic models are used in medicine for investigating patient outcome in relation to patient and disease characteristics. Such models do not always work well in practice, so it is widely recommended that they need to be validated. The idea of validating a prognostic model is generally taken to mean establishing that it works satisfactorily for patients other than those from whose data it was derived. In this paper we examine what is meant by validation and review why it is necessary. We consider how to validate a model and suggest that it is desirable to consider two rather different aspects \textendash{} statistical and clinical validity \textendash{} and examine some general approaches to validation. We illustrate the issues using several case studies. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}

  abstract = {Background: The Treat Stroke to Target (TST) trial showed the benefit of targeting a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration of {$<$}70 mg/dL, in term of reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events in 2860 patients with ischemic stroke with atherosclerotic stenosis of cerebral vasculature. The impact on carotid atherosclerosis evolution is not known. Methods: TST-PLUS (Treat Stroke to Target-PLaque Ultrasound Study) included 201 patients assigned to a LDL-C concentration of {$<$}70 mg/dL and 212 patients assigned to a target of 100{$\pm$}10 mg/dL. To achieve these goals, investigators used the statin and dosage of their choice and added ezetimibe as needed. After certification of ultra-sonographers, carotid ultrasound examinations were performed using M'ATH\texttrademark{} software at baseline, and at 2, 3, and 5 years. All images were up-loaded to the Intelligence in Medical Technology (IMT\texttrademark ) database directly from the carotid ultrasound device. The central core laboratory performed all off-line measurements of the intima-media thickness of both common carotid arteries blinded from the randomization arm. The main outcomes were newly diagnosed atherosclerotic plaque on carotid bifurcation or internal carotid artery origin using the definition of the Mannheim consensus definition, and the between-group comparison of common carotid arteries intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT) change. Results: After a median follow-up of 3.1 years, the achieved LDL-C concentrations were 64 mg/dL (1.64 mmol/L) in the lower-target group and 106 mg/dL (2.72 mmol/L) in the higher-target group. Compared with the higher target-group, patients in the lower target-group had a similar incidence of newly diagnosed carotid plaque: 46/201, (5-year rate, 26.1\%] versus 45/212 (5-year rate, 29.7\%). The change in CCA-IMT was -2.69 \textmu m (95\% CI, -6.55 to 1.18) in the higher-target group and -10.53 \textmu m (95\% CI, -14.21 to -6.85) in the lower-target group, resulting in an absolute between-group difference of -7.84 \textmu m [95\% CI, -13.18 to -2.51], P=0.004). Conclusions: In patients with ischemic stroke and atherosclerosis, an LDL-C target of {$<$}70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) did not reduce the incidence of new carotid plaques but produced significantly greater regression of carotid atherosclerosis than an LDL-C target of 90 to 110 mg/dL.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To refine our understanding of normal ICP values and determine the ICP threshold most strongly associated with outcome. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective observational study (2004-2010), with outcomes determined at hospital discharge. The study included neurocritical care patients from a single level I trauma center, San Francisco General Hospital. Three hundred eighty-three patients had a traumatic brain injury with or without craniectomy; 140 patients had another indication for ICP monitoring. Consecutive patients were studied. Data analyses were completed between March 2015 and December 2019. EXPOSURES Five hundred twenty-three ICP-monitored patients. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A computer system prospectively and automatically collected 1-minute physiologic data from patients in the intensive care unit during a 6-year period. Mean ICP was calculated, as was the proportion of ICP values greater than thresholds from 1 to 80 mm Hg in 1\textendash mm Hg increments. The association between these measures and outcome was explored for various epochs up to 30 days from the time of injury. A principal component analysis was used to explore physiologic changes at various ICP thresholds, and elastic net regression was used to identify ICP thresholds most strongly associated with Glasgow Outcome Scale score at discharge. RESULTS Of the 523 studied patients, 70.7\% of studied patients were men (n = 370) and 72.1\% had a traumatic brain injury (n = 377). A total of 4 090 964 1-minute ICP measurements were recorded for the included patients (7.78 years of recordings). Intracranial pressure values of 8 to 9 mm Hg were most commonly recorded and could possibly reflect normal values. The principal component analysis suggested state shifts in the physiome occurred at ICPs greater than 19 mm Hg and 24 mm Hg. Elastic net regression identified an ICP threshold of 19 mm Hg as most robustly associated with outcome when considering all neurocritical care patients, patients with TBI, and patients with TBI who underwent craniectomy. Intracranial pressure values greater than 19 mm Hg were associated with mortality, while lower values were associated with outcome in surviving patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study provides insight into what normal ICP values could be. An ICP threshold of 19 mm Hg was robustly associated with outcome in studied patients, although lower ICP values were associated with outcome in surviving patients.},

Methods We randomly assigned 2839 patients who had had a spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage within the previous 6 hours and who had elevated systolic blood pressure to receive intensive treatment to lower their blood pressure (with a target systolic level of {$<$}140 mm Hg within 1 hour) or guideline-recommended treatment (with a target systolic level of {$<$}180 mm Hg) with the use of agents of the physician's choosing. The primary outcome was death or major disability, which was defined as a score of 3 to 6 on the modified Rankin scale (in which a score of 0 indicates no symptoms, a score of 5 indicates severe disability, and a score of 6 indicates death) at 90 days. A prespecified ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin score was also performed. The rate of serious adverse events was compared between the two groups. Results Among the 2794 participants for whom the primary outcome could be determined, 719 of 1382 participants (52.0\%) receiving intensive treatment, as compared with 785 of 1412 (55.6\%) receiving guideline-recommended treatment, had a primary outcome event (odds ratio with intensive treatment, 0.87; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 1.01; P\,=\,0.06). The ordinal analysis showed significantly lower modified Rankin scores with intensive treatment (odds ratio for greater disability, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.77 to 1.00; P\,=\,0.04).

Methods We used linked, administrative health care databases to conduct a population-based, retrospective matched cohort study of adult Ontario residents discharged from an ICU between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015, identified using the Discharge Abstract Database. We used propensity scores to match patients who experienced sepsis during their index ICU hospitalization with up to 4 patients who did not experience sepsis. We applied marginal Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the risk of epilepsy within 2 years following the index ICU hospitalization. Among sepsis survivors, Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify factors associated with epilepsy. Results A total of 143,892 patients were included, 32,252 (22.4\%) of whom were exposed. Sepsis survivors were at significantly higher epilepsy risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.44, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.15\textendash 1.80). The risk of epilepsy marginally decreased with increasing age (HR 0.97, 95\% CI 0.96\textendash 0.99); patients with chronic kidney disease (HR 2.25, 95\% CI 1.48\textendash 3.43) were at highest risk. Conclusions In this real-world analysis, sepsis survivors, particularly those who are younger and have chronic kidney disease, are at significantly higher epilepsy risk. These findings indicate that sepsis may be an unrecognized epilepsy risk factor.},

RESULTS A total of 95 patients were enrolled; 43 patients were assigned to the intervention group and 52 to the placebo group. A total of 12 patients (28\%) in the intervention group and 23 (44\%) in the placebo group died by day 90. The analysis of the primary outcome, with accounting for the adaptive design, yielded a risk difference of -19 percentage points (upper boundary of the 97.5\% confidence interval [CI], -3; one-sided P\,=\,0.024). In a prespecified subgroup analysis, treatment within 7 days after symptom onset led to lower 90-day mortality than use of placebo (relative risk, 0.19; 95\% CI, 0.05 to 0.75), whereas later treatment did not. Serious adverse events occurred in 4 patients (9\%) in the intervention group and in 10 (19\%) in the placebo group.

The purpose of this evaluation was to determine the efficacy of fixed-dose 4FPCC in reducing the International Normalized Ratio (INR) to {$\leq$}\,1.5 among warfarin patients with need for urgent or emergent anticoagulation reversal. Starting October 2016, our institution changed from standard 4FPCC FDA-labeled dosing based on the patient's presenting INR and weight, to a fixed-dose of 1500 units for all patients requiring urgent or emergent warfarin reversal. We conducted a retrospective evaluation, after implementation, with the primary outcome being the proportion of patients who achieved an INR\,{$\leq$}\,1.5 with a single fixed-dose of 1500 units of 4FPCC. Secondary outcomes assessed included: medication turnaround times, attainment of target INR\,{$\leq$}\,2 or clinical hemostasis (as judged by the prescribing provider), use of rescue doses, thrombotic events, and cost savings. A total of 37 patients were included in the analysis. Almost 75\% of patients achieved an INR\,{$\leq$}\,1.5 after a single fixed dose of 1500 units, and 100\% of patients achieved an INR\,{$\leq$}\,2. The median pre- and post-dose INRs were 3.06 and 1.32 respectively. Based on this evaluation, the administration of a fixed dose of 1500 units 4FPCC, was shown to be effective in adequately reversing the INR in the majority of patients with minimal thrombotic risks.},

To date there are no widely accepted international guidelines for managing these acute brain-injured patients (stroke, TBI, postneurosurgery) in the ICU. The criteria for ICU admission after neurological acute injury, high-dependency unit or a specialized neurosurgical ward vary from institution to institution depending on local structures and characteristics of the available resources. Better evidence to standardize the treatment and the degree of monitoring is needed during neurological acute injury. It is highly recommended to implement clinical vigilance in these patients regardless of their destination (ICU, stroke unit or ward). Summary Currently evidence do not allow to define standardized protocol to guide ICU admission for acute neurological patients (TBI patients, postoperative neurosurgical procedures and stroke).}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To compare the risk of overcorrection in RIB and SCI with hypertonic saline in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective, investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial enrolled 178 patients older than 18 years with moderately severe to severe hyponatremia and glucose-corrected serum sodium (sNa) levels of 125 mmol/L or less. Recruitment took place from August 24, 2016, until August 21, 2019, across emergency departments and wards of 3 general hospitals in the Republic of Korea. INTERVENTIONS Either RIB or SCI of hypertonic saline, 3\%, for 24 to 48 hours stratified by the severity of clinical symptoms. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES The primary outcome was overcorrection at any given period, defined as increase in the sNa level by greater than 12 or 18 mmol/L within 24 or 48 hours, respectively. Secondary and post hoc outcomes included efficacy and safety of the treatment approaches. The sNa concentrations were measured every 6 hours for 2 days. RESULTS The 178 patients (mean [SD] age, 73.1 [12.2] years; 80 (44.9\%) male; mean [SD] sNa concentrations, 118.2 [5.0] mmol/L) were randomly assigned to the RIB group (n = 87) or the SCI group (n = 91). Overcorrection occurred in 15 of 87 (17.2\%) and 22 of 91 (24.2\%) patients in the RIB and SCI groups, respectively (absolute risk difference, -6.9\% [95\% CI, -18.8\% to 4.9\%]; P = .26). The RIB group showed lower incidence of relowering treatment than the SCI group (36 of 87 [41.4\%] vs 52 of 91 [57.1\%] patients, respectively; absolute risk difference, -15.8\% [95\% CI, -30.3\% to -1.3\%]; P = .04; number needed to treat, 6.3). Groups did not differ in terms of efficacy in increasing sNa concentrations nor improving symptoms, but RIB, when compared with SCI, showed better efficacy in achieving target correction rate within 1 hour (intention-to-treat analysis: 28 of 87 (32.2\%) vs 16 of 91 (17.6\%) patients, respectively; absolute risk difference, 14.6\% [95\% CI, 2\%-27.2\%]; P = .02; number needed to treat, 6.8; per-protocol analysis: 21 of 72 (29.2\%) vs 12 of 73 (16.4\%) patients, respectively; absolute risk difference, 12.7\% [95\% CI, -0.8\% to 26.2\%]; P = .07). The statistical significance of the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were similar for all outcomes except for achieving the target correction rate within 1 hour. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This randomized clinical trial found that both RIB and SIC therapies of hypertonic saline for treating hyponatremia were effective and safe, with no difference in the overcorrection risk. However, RIB had a lower incidence of therapeutic relowering treatment and tended to have a better efficacy in achieving sNa within 1 hour than SCI. RIB could be suggested as the preferred treatment of symptomatic hyponatremia, which is consistent with the current consensus guidelines.},

Prospective validation of this range in patients with ARDS is lacking. We hypothesized that targeting the lower limit of this range would improve outcomes in patients with ARDS. METHODS In this multicenter, randomized trial, we assigned patients with ARDS to receive either conservative oxygen therapy (target Pao2, 55 to 70 mm Hg; oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry [Spo2], 88 to 92\%) or liberal oxygen therapy (target Pao2, 90 to 105 mm Hg; Spo2, {$\geq$}96\%) for 7 days. The same mechanical-ventilation strategies were used in both groups. The primary outcome was death from any cause at 28 days. The authors' affiliations are listed in the Appendix.

RESULTS After the enrollment of 205 patients, the trial was prematurely stopped by the data and safety monitoring board because of safety concerns and a low likelihood of a significant difference between the two groups in the primary outcome. Four patients who did not meet the eligibility criteria were excluded. At day 28, a total of 34 of 99 patients (34.3\%) in the conservative-oxygen group and 27 of 102 patients (26.5\%) in the liberal-oxygen group had died (difference, 7.8 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -4.8 to 20.6). At day 90, 44.4\% of the patients in the conservative-oxygen group and 30.4\% of the patients in the liberal-oxygen group had died (difference, 14.0 percentage points; 95\% CI, 0.7 to 27.2). Five mesenteric ischemic events occurred in the conservative-oxygen group. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with ARDS, early exposure to a conservative-oxygenation strategy with a Pao2 between 55 and 70 mm Hg did not increase survival at 28 days.

Methods To develop and validate these risk equations, we used data from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes study (ACCORD, n=9635; 2001\textendash 09) and validated the equations for microvascular events using data from the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS, n=1018; 1996\textendash 2001), and for cardiovascular events using data from the Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD, n=4760; 2001\textendash 12). Microvascular outcomes were nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Cardiovascular outcomes were myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, and cardiovascular mortality. We also included all-cause mortality as an outcome. We used a cross-validating machine learning method to select predictor variables from demographic characteristics, clinical variables, comorbidities, medications, and biomarkers into Cox proportional hazards models for each outcome. The new equations were compared to older risk equations by assessing model discrimination, calibration, and the net reclassification index. Findings All equations had moderate internal and external discrimination (C-statistics 0{$\cdot$}55\textendash 0{$\cdot$}84 internally, 0{$\cdot$}57\textendash 0{$\cdot$}79 externally) and high internal and external calibration (slopes 0{$\cdot$}71\textendash 1{$\cdot$}31 between observed and estimated risk). Our equations had better discrimination and calibration than the UK Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model 2 (for microvascular and cardiovascular outcomes, C-statistics 0{$\cdot$}54\textendash 0{$\cdot$}62, slopes 0{$\cdot$}06\textendash 1{$\cdot$}12) and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Pooled Cohort Equations (for fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke, C-statistics 0{$\cdot$}61\textendash 0{$\cdot$}66, slopes 0{$\cdot$}30\textendash 0{$\cdot$}39).

Point-Of-Care ultrasound (POCUS) is widely available and could enable clinicians to detect signs of venous congestion at the bedside. The aim of this study was to develop several grading system prototypes using POCUS and to determine their respective ability to predict acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery. This is a post-hoc analysis of a single-center prospective study in 145 patients undergoing cardiac surgery for which repeated daily measurements of hepatic, portal, intra-renal vein Doppler and inferior vena cava (IVC) ultrasound were performed during the first 72 h after surgery. Five prototypes of venous excess ultrasound (VExUS) grading system combining multiple ultrasound markers were developed. Results:\hspace{0.6em} The association between each score and AKI was assessed using time-dependant Cox models as well as conventional performance measures of diagnostic testing. A total of 706 ultrasound assessments were analyzed. We found that defining severe venous congestion as the presence of severe flow abnormalities in multiple Dop-pler patterns with a dilated IVC ({$\geq$}\,2 cm) showed the strongest association with the development of subsequent AKI compared with other combinations (HR: 3.69 CI 1.65\textendash 8.24 p\,=\,0.001). The association remained significant after adjust-ment for baseline risk of AKI and vasopressor/inotropic support (HR: 2.82 CI 1.21\textendash 6.55 p\,=\,0.02). Furthermore, this severe VExUS grade offered a useful positive likelihood ratio (+LR: 6.37 CI 2.19\textendash 18.50) when detected at ICU admis-sion, which outperformed central venous pressure measurements. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} The combination of multiple POCUS markers may identify clinically significant venous congestion.},

Decompressive craniectomy (DC) is a surgical technique aiming to open the ``closed box'' represented by the nonexpandable skull in cases of refractory intracranial hypertension. It is a valuable modality in the armamentarium to treat patients with malignant stroke: the life-saving effect has been proven for both supratentorial and infratentorial DC in virtually all age groups. This leaves physicians with the difficult task to decide who will require early or preemptive surgery and who might benefit from postponing surgery until clear evidence of deterioration evolves. Together with the patient's relatives, physicians also have to ascertain whether the patient will have acceptable disability and quality of life in his or her presumed perception, based on preoperative predictions. This complex decision-making process can only be managed with interdisciplinary efforts and should be supported by continued research in the age of personalized medicine.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Although several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), no antiviral agents have yet been shown to be efficacious. METHODS We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) or placebo for up to 10 days. The primary outcome was the time to recovery, defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only. RESULTS A total of 1062 patients underwent randomization (with 541 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo). Those who received remdesivir had a median recovery time of 10 days (95\% confidence interval [CI], 9 to 11), as compared with 15 days (95\% CI, 13 to 18) among those who received placebo (rate ratio for recovery, 1.29; 95\% CI, 1.12 to 1.49; P{$<$}0.001, by a log-rank test). In an analysis that used a proportional-odds model with an eight-category ordinal scale, the patients who received remdesivir were found to be more likely than those who received placebo to have clinical improvement at day 15 (odds ratio, 1.5; 95\% CI, 1.2 to 1.9, after adjustment for actual disease severity). The Kaplan\textendash Meier estimates of mortality were 6.7\% with remdesivir and 11.9\% with placebo by day 15 and 11.4\% with remdesivir and 15.2\% with placebo by day 29 (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.52 to 1.03). Serious adverse events were reported in 131 of the 532 patients who received remdesivir (24.6\%) and in 163 of the 516 patients who received placebo (31.6\%).

  abstract = {The debate on the use and misuse of P values has risen and fallen throughout their almost century-long existence in scientific discovery. Over the past few years, the debate has again received front-page attention, particularly through the public reminder by the American Statistical Association on how P values should be used and interpreted. At the core of the issue lies a fault in the way that scientific evidence is dichotomized and research is subsequently reported, and this fault is exacerbated by researchers giving license to statistical models to do scientific inference. This paper highlights a different approach to handling the evidence collected during a randomized controlled trial, one that does not dichotomize, but rather reports the evidence collected. Through the use of a coin flipping experiment and reanalysis of real-world data, the traditional approach of testing null hypothesis significance is contrasted with a Bayesian approach. This paper is meant to be understood by those who rely on statistical models to draw conclusions from data, but are not statisticians and may therefore not be able to grasp the debate that is primarily led by statisticians.},

It controls the sleep-wake cycle and vital functions via the ascending reticular activating system and the autonomic nuclei, respectively. Brainstem dysfunction may lead to sensory and motor deficits, cranial nerve palsies, impairment of consciousness, dysautonomia, and respiratory failure. The brainstem is prone to various primary and secondary insults, resulting in acute or chronic dysfunction. Of particular importance for characterizing brainstem dysfunction and identifying the underlying etiology are a detailed clinical examination, MRI, neurophysiologic tests such as brainstem auditory evoked potentials, and an analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid. Detection of brainstem dysfunction is challenging but of utmost importance in comatose and deeply sedated patients both to guide therapy and to support outcome prediction. In the present review, we summarize the neuroanatomy, clinical syndromes, and diagnostic techniques of critical illness-associated brainstem dysfunction for the critical care setting.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Hypertonic saline solutions are increasingly used to treat increased intracranial pressure following severe traumatic brain injury. However, whether hypertonic saline provides superior management of intracranial pressure and improves outcome is unclear. We thus conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effect of hypertonic saline in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Methods: Two researchers independently selected randomized controlled trials studying hypertonic saline in severe traumatic brain injury and collected data using a standardized abstraction form. No language restriction was applied. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, Web of Science, and BIOSIS databases. We searched grey literature via OpenGrey and National Technical Information Service databases. We searched the references of included studies and relevant reviews for additional studies. Results: Eleven studies (1,820 patients) were included. Hypertonic saline did not decrease mortality (risk ratio 0.96, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.83 to 1.11, I2 = 0\%) or improve intracranial pressure control (weighted mean difference -1.25 mm Hg, 95\% CI -4.18 to 1.68, I2 = 78\%) as compared to any other solutions. Only one study reported monitoring for adverse events with hypertonic saline, finding no significant differences between comparison groups. Conclusions: We observed no mortality benefit or effect on the control of intracranial pressure with the use of hypertonic saline when compared to other solutions. Based on the current level of evidence pertaining to mortality or control of intracranial pressure, hypertonic saline could thus not be recommended as a first-line agent for managing patients with severe traumatic brain injury.},

METHODS We conducted a multicenter, double-blind trial in which patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (glycated hemoglobin level, {$\geq$}7\%), chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 25 to 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area), and risks for cardiovascular disease were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive sotagliflozin or placebo. The primary end point was changed during the trial to the composite of the total number of deaths from cardiovascular causes, hospitalizations for heart failure, and urgent visits for heart failure. The trial ended early owing to loss of funding. RESULTS Of 19,188 patients screened, 10,584 were enrolled, with 5292 assigned to the sotagliflozin group and 5292 assigned to the placebo group, and followed for a median of 16 months. The rate of primary end-point events was 5.6 events per 100 patient-years in the sotagliflozin group and 7.5 events per 100 patient-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 0.88; P{$<$}0.001).

For the original coprimary end point of the first occurrence of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, the hazard ratio was 0.84 (95\% CI, 0.72 to 0.99); for the original coprimary end point of the first occurrence of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for heart failure, the hazard ratio was 0.77 (95\% CI, 0.66 to 0.91). Diarrhea, genital mycotic infections, volume depletion, and diabetic ketoacidosis were more common with sotagliflozin than with placebo.

However, the safety and efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors when initiated soon after an episode of decompensated heart failure are unknown. METHODS We performed a multicenter, double-blind trial in which patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were recently hospitalized for worsening heart failure were randomly assigned to receive sotagliflozin or placebo. The primary end point was the total number of deaths from cardiovascular causes and hospitalizations and urgent visits for heart failure (first and subsequent events). The trial ended early because of loss of funding from the sponsor. RESULTS A total of 1222 patients underwent randomization (608 to the sotagliflozin group and 614 to the placebo group) and were followed for a median of 9.0 months; the first dose of sotagliflozin or placebo was administered before discharge in 48.8\% and a median of 2 days after discharge in 51.2\%. Among these patients, 600 primary end-point events occurred (245 in the sotagliflozin group and 355 in the placebo group). The rate (the number of events per 100 patient-years) of primary end-point events was lower in the sotagliflozin group than in the placebo group (51.0 vs. 76.3; hazard ratio, 0.67; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 0.85; P{$<$}0.001). The rate of death from cardiovascular causes was 10.6 in the sotagliflozin group and 12.5 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.58 to 1.22); the rate of death from any cause was 13.5 in the sotagliflozin group and 16.3 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.59 to 1.14). Diarrhea was more common with sotagliflozin than with placebo (6.1\% vs. 3.4\%), as was severe hypoglycemia (1.5\% vs. 0.3\%). The percentage of patients with hypotension was similar in the sotagliflozin group and the placebo group (6.0\% and 4.6\%, respectively), as was the percentage with acute kidney injury (4.1\% and 4.4\%, respectively). The benefits of sotagliflozin were consistent in the prespecified subgroups of patients stratified according to the timing of the first dose.

  abstract = {Demand for intensive care unit (ICU) resources often exceeds supply, and shortages of ICU beds and staff are likely to persist. Triage requires careful weighing of the benefits and risks involved in ICU admission while striving to guarantee fair distribution of available resources. We must ensure that the patients who occupy ICU beds are those most likely to benefit from the ICU's specialized technology and professionals. Although prognosticating is not an exact science, preference should be given to patients who are more likely to survive if admitted to the ICU but unlikely to survive or likely to have more significant morbidity if not admitted. To provide general guidance for intensivists in ICU triage decisions, a task force of the World Federation of Societies of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine addressed 4 basic questions regarding this process. The team made recommendations and concluded that triage should be led by intensivists considering input from nurses, emergency medicine professionals, hospitalists, surgeons, and allied professionals. Triage algorithms and protocols can be useful but can never supplant the role of skilled intensivists basing their decisions on input from multidisciplinary teams. Infrastructures need to be organized efficiently both within individual hospitals and at the regional level. When resources are critically limited, patients may be refused ICU admission if others may benefit more on the basis of the principle of distributive justice.}

After summarizing these systems in the first part our review, our purpose is to describe, in this second part, the anatomy, the possible origins, and courses of the middle meningeal artery. This review is enriched by the correlation of each variant to the related embryologic explanation as well as by some clinical cases shown in the figures.

While several mechanisms contribute to poor outcome, impaired cerebral perfusion appears to be a highly significant common denominator. Management guidelines from the Brain Trauma Foundation recommend measuring ICP to guide therapy. In particular, hyperosmolar therapy, which includes mannitol or hypertonic saline (HTS), is frequently administered to reduce ICP. Currently, mannitol (20\%) is considered the gold standard hyperosmolar agent. However, HTS is increasingly used in this setting. This review sought to compare the efficacy of mannitol to HTS in severe TBI. Methods: The PubMed database was used to systematically search for articles comparing mannitol to HTS in severe TBI. The following medical subject headings were used: HTS, sodium lactate, mannitol, ICP, intracranial hypertension, and TBI. We included both prospective and retrospective randomized controlled studies of adult patients with intracranial hypertension as a result of severe TBI who received hyperosmolar therapy. Results: Out of 45 articles, seven articles were included in our review: 5 were prospective, randomized trials; one was a prospective, nonrandomized trial; and one was a retrospective, cohort study. Conclusions: While all seven studies found that both mannitol and HTS were effective in reducing ICP, there was heterogeneity with regard to which agent was most efficacious.},

  abstract = {Background The Full Outline of Unresponsiveness (FOUR) Score is a validated scale describing the essentials of a coma examination, including motor response, eye opening and eye movements, brainstem reflexes, and respiratory pattern. We incorporated the FOUR Score into the existing ICH Score and evaluated its accuracy of risk assessment in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Materials and Methods Consecutive patients admitted to our institution from 2009 to 2012 with spontaneous ICH were reviewed. The ICH Score was calculated using patient age, hemorrhage location, hemorrhage volume, evidence of intraventricular extension, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The FOUR Score was then incorporated into the ICH Score as a substitute for the GCS (ICH ScoreFS). The ability of the 2 scores to predict mortality at 1 month was then compared. Results In total, 274 patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age was 73 years (interquartile range 60-82) and 138 (50.4\%) were male. Overall mortality at 1 month was 28.8\% (n\,=\,79). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was .91 for the ICH Score and .89 for the ICH ScoreFS. For ICH Scores of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, 1-month mortality was 4.2\%, 29.9\%, 62.5\%, 95.0\%, and 100\%. In the ICH ScoreFS model, mortality was 10.7\%, 26.5\%, 64.5\%, 88.9\%, and 100\% for scores of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Conclusions The ICH Score and the ICH ScoreFS predict 1-month mortality with comparable accuracy. As the FOUR Score provides additional clinical information regarding patient status, it may be a reasonable substitute for the GCS into the ICH Score.},

  abstract = {This paper considers an important recent (May 2018) contribution by Miguel Hern\'an to the ongoing debate about causal inference in epidemiology. Hern\'an rejects the idea that there is an in-principle epistemic distinction between the results of randomized controlled trials and observational studies: both produce associations which we may be more or less confident interpreting as causal. However, Hern\'an maintains that trials have a semantic advantage. Observational studies that seek to estimate causal effect risk issuing meaningless statements instead. The POA proposes a solution to this problem: improved restrictions on the meaningful use of causal language, in particular ``causal effect''. This paper argues that new restrictions in fact fail their own standards of meaningfulness. The paper portrays the desire for a restrictive definition of causal language as positivistic, and argues that contemporary epidemiology should be more realistic in its approach to causation. In a realist context, restrictions on meaningfulness based on precision of definition are neither helpful nor necessary. Hern\'an's favoured approach to causal language is saved from meaninglessness, along with the approaches he rejects.},

  abstract = {Background: Data extraction forms link systematic reviews with primary research and provide the foundation for appraising, analysing, summarising and interpreting a body of evidence. This makes their development, pilot testing and use a crucial part of the systematic reviews process. Several studies have shown that data extraction errors are frequent in systematic reviews, especially regarding outcome data. Methods: We reviewed guidance on the development and pilot testing of data extraction forms and the data extraction process. We reviewed four types of sources: 1) methodological handbooks of systematic review organisations (SRO); 2) textbooks on conducting systematic reviews; 3) method documents from health technology assessment (HTA) agencies and 4) journal articles. HTA documents were retrieved in February 2019 and database searches conducted in December 2019. One author extracted the recommendations and a second author checked them for accuracy. Results are presented descriptively. Results: Our analysis includes recommendations from 25 documents: 4 SRO handbooks, 11 textbooks, 5 HTA method documents and 5 journal articles. Across these sources the most common recommendations on form development are to use customized or adapted standardised extraction forms (14/25); provide detailed instructions on their use (10/25); ensure clear and consistent coding and response options (9/25); plan in advance which data are needed (9/25); obtain additional data if required (8/25); and link multiple reports of the same study (8/25). The most frequent recommendations on piloting extractions forms are that forms should be piloted on a sample of studies (18/25); and that data extractors should be trained in the use of the forms (7/25). The most frequent recommendations on data extraction are that extraction should be conducted by at least two people (17/25); that independent parallel extraction should be used (11/25); and that procedures to resolve disagreements between data extractors should be in place (14/25). Conclusions: Overall, our results suggest a lack of comprehensiveness of recommendations. This may be particularly problematic for less experienced reviewers. Limitations of our method are the scoping nature of the review and that we did not analyse internal documents of health technology agencies.},

However, data from recent studies argue against a pure focus on vasospasm as the cause of delayed ischaemic complications. Findings that marked reduction in the incidence of vasospasm does not translate to a reduction in DCI, or better outcomes has intensified research into other possible mechanisms which may promote ischaemic complications. Early brain injury and cell death, blood-brain barrier disruption and initiation of an inflammatory cascade, microvascular spasm, microthrombosis, cortical spreading depolarisations and failure of cerebral autoregulation, have all been implicated in the pathophysiology of DCI. This review summarises the current knowledge about the mechanisms underlying the development of DCI. Furthermore, it aims to describe and categorise the known pharmacological treatment options with respect to the presumed mechanism of action and its role in DCI.},

Data Sources: PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) were searched (inception to November 2015) using hypertonic saline solutions, sodium chloride, mannitol, osmotic diuretic, traumatic brain injury, brain injuries, and head injury. Searches were limited to humans. Clinical practice guidelines and bibliographies were reviewed. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Prospective, randomized trials comparing HTS and mannitol in adults ({$\geq$}16 years) with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score {$\leq$}8) and elevated ICP were included. ICP elevation, ICP reduction, and treatment failure were defined using study definitions. Data Synthesis: Of 326 articles screened, 7 trials enrolling a total of 191 patients met inclusion criteria. Studies were underpowered to detect a significant difference in mortality or neurological outcomes. Due to significant heterogeneity and differences in reporting ICP change from baseline, this outcome was not meta-analyzed. No difference between HTS and mannitol was observed for mean ICP reduction; however, risk of ICP treatment failure favored HTS (risk ratio [RR] = 0.39; 95\% CI = 0.18-0.81). Serious adverse events were not reported. Conclusions: Based on limited data, clinically important differences in mortality, neurological outcomes, and ICP reduction were not observed between HTS or mannitol in the management of severe TBI. HTS appears to lead to fewer ICP treatment failures.},

In this Tutorial, we first explain the three major classes of ordinal models: the cumulative, sequential, and adjacent-category models. We then show how to fit ordinal models in a fully Bayesian framework with the R package brms, using data sets on opinions about stem-cell research and time courses of marriage. The appendices provide detailed mathematical derivations of the models and a discussion of censored ordinal models. Compared with metric models, ordinal models provide better theoretical interpretation and numerical inference from ordinal data, and we recommend their widespread adoption in psychology.},

We conducted a systematic scoping review to answer these questions by searching the literature on AT in English language available in PubMed or EMBASE since 1980. Pediatric or animal studies were excluded. A total of 87 articles matched our inclusion criteria and were qualitatively synthesized in this review. A large body of the literature on AT since its inception addresses a variety of modifications, monitoring techniques, complication rates, ways to perform AT on ECMO, and other considerations such as variability in protocols, lack of uniform awareness, and legal considerations. Only some modifications are widely used, especially methods to maintain oxygenation, and most are not standardized or endorsed by brain death guidelines. Future updates to AT protocols and strive for unification of such protocols are desirable.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study compared outcomes for 1319 patients who were comatose after cardiac arrest at a single center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from January 2010 to December 2018. Initial illness severity was based on coma and organ failure scores, presence of severe cerebral edema, and presence of highly malignant electroencephalogram (EEG) after resuscitation. EXPOSURE TTM at 36 \textdegree C or 33 \textdegree C. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge, and secondary outcomes were modified Rankin Scale and cerebral performance category. RESULTS Among 1319 patients, 728 (55.2\%) had TTM at 33 \textdegree C (451 [62.0\%] men; median [interquartile range] age, 61 [50-72] years) and 591 (44.8\%) had TTM at 36 \textdegree C (353 [59.7\%] men; median [interquartile range] age, 59 [48-69] years). Overall, 184 of 187 patients (98.4\%) with severe cerebral edema died and 234 of 243 patients (96.3\%) with highly malignant EEG died regardless of TTM strategy. Comparing TTM at 33 \textdegree C with TTM at 36 \textdegree C in 911 patients (69.1\%) with neither severe cerebral edema nor highly malignant EEG, survival was lower in patients with mild to moderate coma and no shock (risk difference, \textendash 13.8\%; 95\% CI, \textendash 24.4\% to \textendash 3.2\%) but higher in patients with mild to moderate coma and cardiopulmonary failure (risk difference, 21.8\%; 95\% CI, 5.4\% to 38.2\%) or with severe coma (risk difference, 9.7\%; 95\% CI, 4.0\% to 15.3\%). Interactions were similar for functional outcomes. Most deaths (633 of 968 [65.4\%]) resulted after withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, TTM at 33 \textdegree C was associated with better survival than TTM at 36 \textdegree C among patients with the most severe post\textendash cardiac arrest illness but without severe cerebral edema or malignant EEG. However, TTM at 36 \textdegree C was associated with better survival among patients with mild- to moderate-severity illness.},

There is a clear urgency to collate, review, appraise and act on this information if we are to do the best for clinicians and patients. However, the speed of the pandemic is a threat to traditional models of knowledge translation and practice change. In this concepts paper, we argue that clinicians need to be agile in their thinking and practice in order to find the right time to change. Adoption of new methods should be based on clinical judgement, the weight of evidence and the balance of probabilities that any new technique, test or treatment might work. The pandemic requires all of us to reach a new level of evidence-\-based medicine characterised by scepticism, thoughtfulness, responsiveness and clinically agility in practice.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash EG-1962 is a sustained release formulation of nimodipine administered via external ventricular drain in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. A randomized, open-label, phase 1/2a, dose-escalation study provided impetus for this study to evaluate efficacy and safety of a single intraventricular 600 mg dose of EG-1962 to patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, compared with standard of care oral nimodipine. Methods\textemdash Subjects were World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grades 2\textendash 4, modified Fisher grades 2\textendash 4 and had an external ventricular drain inserted as part of standard of care. The primary end point was the proportion of subjects with favorable outcome at day 90 after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (extended Glasgow outcome scale 6\textendash 8). The proportion of subjects with favorable outcome at day 90 on the Montreal cognitive assessment, as well as the incidence of delayed cerebral ischemia and infarction, use of rescue therapy and safety were evaluated. Results\textemdash The study was halted by the independent data monitoring board after planned interim analysis of 210 subjects (289 randomized) with day 90 outcome found the study was unlikely to achieve its primary end point. After day 90 followup of all subjects, the proportion with favorable outcome on the extended Glasgow outcome scale was 45\% (65/144) in the EG-1962 and 42\% (62/145) in the placebo group (risk ratio, 1.01 [95\% CI, 0.83\textendash 1.22], P=0.95). Consistent with its mechanism of action, EG-1962 significantly reduced vasospasm (50\% [69/138] EG-1962 versus 63\% [91/144], P=0.025) and hypotension (7\% [9/138] versus 10\% [14/144]). Analysis of prespecified subject strata suggested potential efficacy in World Federation of Neurological Surgeons 3\textendash 4 subjects (46\% [32/69] EG-1962 versus 32\% [24/75] placebo, odds ratio, 1.22 [95\% CI, 0.94\textendash 1.58], P=0.13). No safety concerns were identified that halted the study or that preclude further development. Conclusions\textemdash There was no significant increase in favorable outcome for EG-1962 compared with standard of care in the overall study population. The safety profile was acceptable.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate outcome and safety of endovascular treatment beyond 6 hours of onset of ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation, in routine clinical practice. METHODS: From the Italian Registry of Endovascular Thrombectomy, we extracted clinical and outcome data of patients treated for stroke of known onset beyond 6 hours. Additional inclusion criteria were prestroke modified Rankin Scale score {$\leq$}2 and ASPECTS score {$\geq$}6. Patients were selected on individual basis by a combination of CT perfusion mismatch (difference between total hypoperfusion and infarct core sizes) and CT collateral score. The primary outcome measure was the score on modified Rankin Scale at 90 days. Safety outcomes were 90-day mortality and the occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Data were compared with those from patients treated within 6 hours. RESULTS: Out of 3057 patients, 327 were treated beyond 6 hours. Their mean age was 66.8{$\pm$}14.9 years, the median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 16, and the median onset to groin puncture time 430 minutes. The most frequent site of occlusion was middle cerebral artery (45.1\%). Functional independence (90-day modified Rankin Scale score, 0\textendash 2) was achieved by 41.3\% of cases. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 6.7\% of patients, and 3-month case fatality rate was 17.1\%. The probability of surviving with modified Rankin Scale score, 0\textendash 2 (odds ratio, 0.58 [95\% CI, 0.43\textendash 0.77]) was significantly lower in patients treated beyond 6 hours as compared with patients treated earlier No differences were found regarding recanalization rates and safety outcomes between patients treated within and beyond 6 hours. There were no differences in outcome between people treated 6-12 hours from onset (278 patients) and those treated 12 to 24 hours from onset (49 patients). CONCLUSIONS: This real-world study suggests that in patients with large vessel occlusion selected on the basis of CT perfusion and collateral circulation assessment, endovascular treatment beyond 6 hours is feasible and safe with no increase in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antiplatelet treatment remains the first choice for primary and secondary prevention of vascular diseases; even so, expected benefits may be offset by risk of bleeding, particularly cerebral hemorrhage. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of antiplatelet treatment on clinical outcome at hospital discharge. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with first-ever stroke due to a primary intraparenchymal hemorrhage were prospectively identified over a 4-year period (2000-2003). Data on hemorrhage location, vascular risk factors, and antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatment were collected. At discharge, outcome was measured using the modified Rankin Scale (disabling stroke {$>$} or =3). Patients treated with anticoagulant therapy were excluded from the study. RESULTS: Of 457 consecutive patients with cerebral hemorrhage, 94 (20.5\%) had been taking antiplatelet agents. The treated patients (mean age for antiplatelet group 78.9 +/- 9.0 years) were older than the nontreated patients (73.8 +/- 9.4, p = 0.02). In-hospital mortality was 23.4 and 23.1\% (p = n.s.) for patients who had been taking antiplatelet agents or no treatment. Poor outcome at discharge was found in 52.1 and 59.7\% (p = n.s.), respectively. Univariate analysis showed that age and coma at admission were predictors of disability at discharge, but antiplatelet treatment was not. Additionally, age and coma were shown to be determinants of disability at discharge after multivariate analysis: OR 1.03 per year (95\% CI: 1.018-1.049), p {$<$} 0.001 and OR 1.68 (95\% CI: 1.138-2.503), p = 0.009, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Hemorrhagic stroke continues to be responsible for a high percentage of disability and death. Furthermore, it was seen here that functional outcome was independent of previous antiplatelet treatment.},

  abstract = {To analyze the efficacy and safety of activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCC) and four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (4F-PCC) to prevent hematoma expansion in patients taking apixaban or rivaroxaban with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). In this multicenter, retrospective study, sixty-seven ICH patients who received aPCC or 4F-PCC for known use of apixaban or rivaroxaban between February 2014 and September 2018 were included. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who achieved excellent/good or poor hemostasis after administration of aPCC or 4F-PCC. Secondary outcomes included hospital mortality, thromboembolic events during admission, and transfusion requirements. Excellent/good hemostasis was achieved in 87\% of aPCC patients, 89\% of low-dose 4F-PCC [{$<$}\,30 units per kilogram (kg)], and 89\% of high-dose 4F-PCC ({$\geq$}\,30 units per kg). There were no significant differences in excellent/good or poor hemostatic efficacy (p\,=\,0.362). No differences were identified in transfusions 6 h prior (p\,=\,0.087) or 12 h after (p\,=\,0.178) the reversal agent. Mortality occurred in five patients, with no differences among the groups (p\,=\,0.838). There were no inpatient thromboembolic events. Both aPCC and 4F-PCC appear safe and equally associated with hematoma stability in patients taking apixaban or rivaroxaban who present with ICH. Prospective studies are needed to identify a superior reversal agent when comparing andexanet alfa to hospital standard of care (4F-PCC or aPCC) and to further explore the optimal dosing strategy for patients with ICH associated with apixaban or rivaroxaban use.},

  abstract = {Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is one of the most demanding conditions in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Management of analgesia and sedation in ARDS is particularly challenging. An expert panel was convened to produce a ``state-of-the-art'' article to support clinicians in the optimal management of analgesia/sedation in mechani-cally ventilated adults with ARDS, including those with COVID-19. Current ICU analgesia/sedation guidelines promote analgesia first and minimization of sedation, wakefulness, delirium prevention and early rehabilitation to facilitate ven-tilator and ICU liberation. However, these strategies cannot always be applied to patients with ARDS who sometimes require deep sedation and/or paralysis. Patients with severe ARDS may be under-represented in analgesia/sedation studies and currently recommended strategies may not be feasible. With lightened sedation, distress-related symp-toms (e.g., pain and discomfort, anxiety, dyspnea) and patient-ventilator asynchrony should be systematically assessed and managed through interprofessional collaboration, prioritizing analgesia and anxiolysis. Adaptation of ventilator settings (e.g., use of a pressure-set mode, spontaneous breathing, sensitive inspiratory trigger) should be systemati-cally considered before additional medications are administered. Managing the mechanical ventilator is of paramount importance to avoid the unnecessary use of deep sedation and/or paralysis. Therefore, applying an ``ABCDEF-R'' bundle (R\,=\,Respiratory-drive-control) may be beneficial in ARDS patients. Further studies are needed, especially regarding the use and long-term effects of fast-offset drugs (e.g., remifentanil, volatile anesthetics) and the electrophysiological assessment of analgesia/sedation (e.g., electroencephalogram devices, heart-rate variability, and video pupillometry). This review is particularly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic given drug shortages and limited ICU-bed capacity.},

Methods:\hspace{0.6em} Our consensus working group consisted of 42 experienced and actively practicing sTBI opinion leaders from six continents.

The management protocols were developed through a Delphi-method-based consensus approach and were finalized at an in-person meeting. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We established three distinct treatment protocols, each with three tiers whereby higher tiers involve therapies with higher risk. One protocol addresses the management of ICP elevation when brain oxygenation is normal. A second addresses management of brain hypoxia with normal ICP. The third protocol addresses the situation when both intracranial hypertension and brain hypoxia are present.

  abstract = {Background Intracranial-pressure monitoring is considered the standard of care for severe traumatic brain injury and is used frequently, but the efficacy of treatment based on monitoring in improving the outcome has not been rigorously assessed. Methods We conducted a multicenter, controlled trial in which 324 patients 13 years of age or older who had severe traumatic brain injury and were being treated in intensive care units (ICUs) in Bolivia or Ecuador were randomly assigned to one of two specific protocols: guidelines-based management in which a protocol for monitoring intraparenchymal intracranial pressure was used (pressure-monitoring group) or a protocol in which treatment was based on imaging and clinical examination (imaging\textendash clinical examination group). The primary outcome was a composite of survival time, impaired consciousness, and functional status at 3 months and 6 months and neuropsychological status at 6 months; neuropsychological status was assessed by an examiner who was unaware of protocol assignment. This composite measure was based on performance across 21 measures of functional and cognitive status and calculated as a percentile (with 0 indicating the worst performance, and 100 the best performance). Results There was no significant between-group difference in the primary outcome, a composite measure based on percentile performance across 21 measures of functional and cognitive status (score, 56 in the pressure-monitoring group vs. 53 in the imaging\textendash clinical examination group; P\,=\,0.49). Six-month mortality was 39\% in the pressure-monitoring group and 41\% in the imaging\textendash clinical examination group (P\,=\,0.60). The median length of stay in the ICU was similar in the two groups (12 days in the pressure-monitoring group and 9 days in the imaging\textendash clinical examination group; P\,=\,0.25), although the number of days of brain-specific treatments (e.g., administration of hyperosmolar fluids and the use of hyperventilation) in the ICU was higher in the imaging\textendash clinical examination group than in the pressure-monitoring group (4.8 vs. 3.4, P\,=\,0.002).

  abstract = {Background Atherosclerotic intracranial arterial stenosis is an important cause of stroke that is increasingly being treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) to prevent recurrent stroke. However, PTAS has not been compared with medical management in a randomized trial. Methods We randomly assigned patients who had a recent transient ischemic attack or stroke attributed to stenosis of 70 to 99\% of the diameter of a major intracranial artery to aggressive medical management alone or aggressive medical management plus PTAS with the use of the Wingspan stent system. The primary end point was stroke or death within 30 days after enrollment or after a revascularization procedure for the qualifying lesion during the follow-up period or stroke in the territory of the qualifying artery beyond 30 days. Results Enrollment was stopped after 451 patients underwent randomization, because the 30-day rate of stroke or death was 14.7\% in the PTAS group (nonfatal stroke, 12.5\%; fatal stroke, 2.2\%) and 5.8\% in the medical-management group (nonfatal stroke, 5.3\%; non\textendash stroke-related death, 0.4\%) (P\,=\,0.002). Beyond 30 days, stroke in the same territory occurred in 13 patients in each group. Currently, the mean duration of followup, which is ongoing, is 11.9 months. The probability of the occurrence of a primary end-point event over time differed significantly between the two treatment groups (P\,=\,0.009), with 1-year rates of the primary end point of 20.0\% in the PTAS group and 12.2\% in the medical-management group.

Methods:\hspace{0.6em} Thirty-two consecutive, mechanically ventilated COVID-19-ARDS patients were compared to two historical ARDS sub-populations 1:1 matched for \-PaO2/FiO2 or for compliance of the respiratory system. Gas exchange, hemodynamics and respiratory mechanics were recorded at 5 and 15 \-cmH2O PEEP. CT scan variables were measured at 5 \-cmH2O PEEP. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Anthropometric characteristics were similar in COVID-19-ARDS, \-PaO2/FiO2-matched-ARDS and Compliance-matched-ARDS. The \-PaO2/FiO2-matched-ARDS and COVID-19-ARDS populations (both with \-PaO2/FiO2 106\,{$\pm$}\,59 mmHg) had different respiratory system compliances (Crs) (39\,{$\pm$}\,11 vs 49.9\,{$\pm$}\,15.4 ml/cmH2O, p\,=\,0.03). The Compliance-matched-ARDS and COVID-19-ARDS had similar Crs (50.1\,{$\pm$}\,15.7 and 49.9\,{$\pm$}\,15.4 ml/cmH2O, respectively) but significantly lower \-PaO2/FiO2 for the same Crs (160\,{$\pm$}\,62 vs 106.5\,{$\pm$}\,59.6 mmHg, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). The three populations had similar lung weights but COVID-19-ARDS had significantly higher lung gas volume (\-PaO2/FiO2-matched-ARDS 930\,{$\pm$}\,644 ml, COVID-19-ARDS 1670\,{$\pm$}\,791 ml and Compliance-matched-ARDS 1301\,{$\pm$}\,627 ml, p\,{$<$}\,0.05). The venous admixture was significantly related to the non-aerated tissue in \-PaO2/FiO2-matched-ARDS and Compliance-matchedARDS (p\,{$<$}\,0.001) but unrelated in COVID-19-ARDS (p\,=\,0.75), suggesting that hypoxemia was not only due to the extent of non-aerated tissue. Increasing PEEP from 5 to 15 \-cmH2O improved oxygenation in all groups. However, while lung mechanics and dead space improved in \-PaO2/FiO2-matched-ARDS, suggesting recruitment as primary mechanism, they remained unmodified or worsened in COVID-19-ARDS and Compliance-matched-ARDS, suggesting lower recruitment potential and/or blood flow redistribution. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} COVID-19-ARDS is a subset of ARDS characterized overall by higher compliance and lung gas volume for a given \-PaO2/FiO2, at least when considered within the timeframe of our study.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Contrast-induced encephalopathy (CIE) is a rare and underrecognized complication after endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke. This study investigated the incidence and risk factors of CIE in patients who underwent EVT. METHODS: Consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke who received EVT between September 2014 and December 2019 at 2 medical centers were included. CIE was diagnosed on clinical criteria of neurological deterioration or delayed improvement within 24 hours after the procedure that was unexplained by the infarct or hemorrhagic transformation and radiological criterion of edematous change extending beyond the infarct core accompanied by contrast staining. RESULTS: Of 421 patients with acute ischemic stroke who received EVT, 7 (1.7\%) developed CIE. The manifestations included worsening of focal neurological signs, coma, and seizure. Patients with CIE were more likely to experience contrast-induced acute kidney injury than were those without CIE, but the volume of contrast medium was comparable between the two groups. The independent risk factors for CIE included renal dysfunction (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate\,{$<$}45 mL/min per 1.73 m2; odds ratio, 5.77 [95\% CI, 1.37\textendash 24.3]; P=0.02) and history of stroke (odds ratio, 4.96 [95\% CI, 1.15\textendash 21.3]; P=0.03). Patients with CIE were less likely to achieve favorable functional outcomes (odds ratio, 0.09 [95\% CI, 0.01\textendash 0.87]; P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: CIE should be suspected in patients with clinical worsening after EVT accompanied by imaging evidence of contrast staining and edematous changes, especially in patients with renal dysfunction or history of stroke.},

RESULTS A total of 16 of 104 unresponsive patients (15\%) had brain activation detected by EEG at a median of 4 days after injury. The condition in 8 of these 16 patients (50\%) and in 23 of 88 patients (26\%) without brain activation improved such that they were able to follow commands before discharge. At 12 months, 7 of 16 patients (44\%) with brain activation and 12 of 84 patients (14\%) without brain activation had a GOS-E level of 4 or higher, denoting the ability to function independently for 8 hours (odds ratio, 4.6; 95\% confidence interval, 1.2 to 17.1).

  abstract = {Objective: Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) due to vasospasm is often undetected by clinical exam in patients with poor-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The purpose of this study was to identify quantitative EEG (qEEG) parameters that are most sensitive and specific for the detection of DCI in stuporous or comatose SAH patients. Methods: Of 78 consecutive Hunt\textendash Hess grade 4 or 5 SAH patients admitted to our Neuro-ICU over a 2-year period, 48 were eligible for participation and 34 were enrolled. Continuous EEG monitoring was performed from post-operative day 2 to post-SAH day 14. In each patient, 20 artifact-free, 1 min EEG-clips following an alerting stimulus were analyzed: 10 clips were obtained on monitoring day 1 (baseline), and 10 on days 4\textendash 6 (follow-up). In DCI patients, follow-up clips were obtained after the onset of deterioration and before infarction had occurred. Twelve qEEG parameters were calculated using fast Fourier transformation; generalized estimating equations were used to compare ratios of change in qEEG parameters in patients with and without DCI. Results: Nine of 34 patients (26\%) developed DCI. The alpha/delta ratio (alpha power/delta power; ADR) demonstrated the strongest association with DCI. The median decrease of ADR for patients with DCI was 24\%, compared to an increase of 3\% for patients without DCI (ZZ4.0, P!0.0001). Clinically useful cut-offs included 6 consecutive recordings with a O10\% decrease in ADR from baseline (sensitivity 100\%, specificity 76\%) and any single measurement with a O50\% decrease (sensitivity 89\%, specificity 84\%). Conclusions: A decrease in the ADR may be a sensitive method of detecting DCI, with reasonable specificity. This post-stimulation qEEG parameter may supplement the clinical exam in poor-grade SAH patients and may prove useful for the detection of DCI. Significance: Following ADRs may allow earlier detection of DCI and initiation of interventions at a reversible stage, thus preventing infarction and neurological morbidity. q 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

  abstract = {Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has been associated with numerous pathophysiological sequelae, including large artery vasospasm and microvascular thrombosis. The focus of this review is to provide an overview of experimental animal model studies and human autopsy studies that explore the temporalspatial characterization and mechanism of microvascular platelet aggregation and thrombosis following SAH, as well as to critically assess experimental studies and clinical trials highlighting preventative therapeutic options against this highly morbid pathophysiological process. Upon review of the literature, we discovered that microvascular platelet aggregation and thrombosis occur after experimental SAH across multiple species and SAH induction techniques in a similar time frame to other components of DCI, occurring in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus across both hemispheres. We discuss the relationship of these findings to human autopsy studies. In the final section of this review, we highlight the important therapeutic options for targeting microvascular platelet aggregation and thrombosis, and emphasize why therapeutic targeting of this neurovascular pathology may improve patient care. We encourage ongoing research into the pathophysiology of SAH and DCI, especially in regard to microvascular platelet aggregation and thrombosis and the translation to randomized clinical trials.},

Yet, there is not always a direct one-to-one correlation between functional disability and subjective quality of life. This research investigated the complexity of factors that influence quality of life after stroke, using qualitative interviews. Results indicate that a stroke has a significant impact on the quality of life of survivors, but some individuals find ways to adapt to their functional disabilities and report a high quality of life. Common elements of this process consist of reordering priorities to focus on those activities considered most salient to an individual's identity; then drawing on existing resources, including health services and social supports, to maintain a customary activity, even in a modified form, retaining salient aspects of the individual's identity and maintaining a sense of continuity in his or her life.},

  abstract = {Background: The optimal timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT) initiation for acute kidney injury (AKI) is unknown. There is debate as to whether starting RRT earlier for AKI is superior to starting it only after `conventional', life-threatening indications are present. Summary: In recent years, there has been an ongoing trend in clinical practice to initiate RRT for AKI long before indications appear. Observational studies show many patients now begin RRT for AKI in the absence of `conventional' indications. While this shift may have been prompted by observational studies suggesting improved outcomes with earlier RRT, there was not sufficient justification for a change in clinical practice: many recent, observational studies suggest that early RRT may not beneficial or may be even harmful. Moreover, none of 3 underpowered RCTs reported to date found `early' RRT initiation beneficial. Lowering the threshold for RRT initiation inevitably leads to more patients receiving unnecessary treatment and this is a matter of concern, considering the fact that complications are potentially fatal and RRT is very costly. While we await definitive studies, calls to shift clinical practice back toward the initiation of RRT for `conventional', life-threatening indications only, should be heeded. Key Messages: `Earlier' initiation of RRT for AKI is already occurring in clinical practice but is not justified on the basis of the studies to date. Lowering the threshold for initiation leads to more patients receiving unnecessary RRT. RRT has potentially fatal complications and is expensive. While we await definitive trials, RRT should be started only after `conventional', life-threatening indications occur and not earlier.},

  abstract = {Background Optimal fluid management in patients with acute lung injury is unknown. Diuresis or fluid restriction may improve lung function but could jeopardize extrapulmonaryorgan perfusion. Methods In a randomized study, we compared a conservative and a liberal strategy of fluid management using explicit protocols applied for seven days in 1000 patients with acute lung injury. The primary end point was death at 60 days. Secondary end points included the number of ventilator-free days and organ-failure\textendash free days and measures of lung physiology. Results The rate of death at 60 days was 25.5 percent in the conservative-strategy group and 28.4 percent in the liberal-strategy group (P = 0.30; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -2.6 to 8.4 percent). The mean ({$\pm$}SE) cumulative fluid balance during the first seven days was \textendash 136{$\pm$}491 ml in the conservative-strategy group and 6992{$\pm$}502 ml in the liberal-strategy group (P{$<$}0.001). As compared with the liberal strategy, the conservative strategy improved the oxygenation index ([mean airway pressure \texttimes{} the ratio of the fraction of inspired oxygen to the partial pressure of arterial oxygen] \texttimes{} 100) and the lung injury score and increased the number of ventilatorfree days (14.6{$\pm$}0.5 vs. 12.1{$\pm$}0.5, P{$<$}0.001) and days not spent in the intensive care unit (13.4{$\pm$}0.4 vs. 11.2{$\pm$}0.4, P{$<$}0.001) during the first 28 days but did not increase the incidence or prevalence of shock during the study or the use of dialysis during the first 60 days (10 percent vs. 14 percent, P = 0.06). Conclusions Although there was no significant difference in the primary outcome of 60-day mortality, the conservative strategy of fluid management improved lung function and shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care without increasing nonpulmonary-organ failures. These results support the use of a conservative strategy of fluid management in patients with acute lung injury. (ClinicalTrials. gov number, NCT00281268.)},

We used published meta-analyses to identify randomized clinical trials and observational studies that examined the same clinical topics. We then compared the results of the original reports according to the type of research design. Methods A search of the Medline data base for articles published in five major medical journals from 1991 to 1995 identified meta-analyses of randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses of either cohort or case\textendash control studies that assessed the same intervention. For each of five topics, summary estimates and 95 percent confidence intervals were calculated on the basis of data from the individual randomized, controlled trials and the individual observational studies. Results For the five clinical topics and 99 reports evaluated, the average results of the observational studies were remarkably similar to those of the randomized, controlled trials. For example, analysis of 13 randomized, controlled trials of the effectiveness of bacille Calmette\textendash Gu\'erin vaccine in preventing active tuberculosis yielded a relative risk of 0.49 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.70) among vaccinated patients, as compared with an odds ratio of 0.50 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.65) from 10 case\textendash control studies. In addition, the range of the point estimates for the effect of vaccination was wider for the randomized, controlled trials (0.20 to 1.56) than for the observational studies (0.17 to 0.84). Conclusions The results of well-designed observational studies (with either a cohort or a case\textendash control design) do not systematically overestimate the magnitude of the effects of treatment as compared with those in randomized, controlled trials on the same topic.

  abstract = {Background and Purpose: Thirty-day mortality rates in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) range from 35\% to 50\%, with only 10\textendash 20\% of the survivors regaining functional independence. This high mortality and morbidity argues for the optimization of emergency medical services (EMS), emergency department (ED), and in-patient treatment paradigms. With the development of interventional strategies for ICH, both pharmacologic and surgical, time to treatment will be critical to improving outcomes. Similar to acute ischemic stroke care, proper preparation and role definition will be critical for efficient evaluation and treatment. We studied the existence and structure of ICH management protocols in US hospitals. Methods: A national survey of Emergency Medicine physicians was conducted to gather information regarding the existence of stroke and ICH treatment protocols at their institutions. Results: A clearly established pathway for the management of ischemic stroke exists in most hospitals (78\%). By contrast, only 30\% of hospitals have a clearly defined pathway for ICH. Thus, while most hospitals are able to perform rapid computed tomography (CT) scans to diagnose ICH, the management of these patients post-CT is more fragmented and variable. Few hospitals have comprehensive protocols that include treatment policies for raised intracranial pressure or formal policies for the transfer of patients to centers with neurocritical care/neurosurgical resources. Recommendations: Integration of ICH critical pathways into stroke protocols could potentially improve the high mortality and disability associated with this condition and might facilitate ongoing studies of ICH-specific interventions. With stroke neurologists and neurocritical care specialists showing an increasing interest in ICH management, development of critical pathways may allow for a standardized approach to best treatment practices within institutions and networks as evidence grows for new treatments and management strategies. This may also allow a redefinition of the roles of team members, including ED and critical care physicians, neurologists, and neurosurgeons.}

Forty-seven severe TBI patients with increased ICP were prospectively recruited in two university hospitals and randomly treated with equiosmolar infusions of either MTL 20\% (4 mL/kg; n = 25 patients) or HTS 7.5\% (2 mL/kg; n = 22 patients). Serum sodium, hematocrit, ICP, arterial blood pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), shear rate, global indices of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism were measured before, and 30 and 120 min following each infusion during the course of illness. Outcome was assessed at 6 months. Both HTS and MTL effectively and equally reduced ICP levels with subsequent elevation of CPP and CBF, although this effect was significantly stronger and of longer duration after HTS and correlated with improved rheological blood properties induced by HTS. Further, effect of HTS on ICP appeared to be more robust in patients with diffuse brain injury. In contrast, oxygen and glucose metabolic rates were left equally unaffected by both solutions. Accordingly, there was no significant difference in neurological outcome between the two groups. In conclusion, MTL was as effective as HTS in decreasing ICP in TBI patients although both solutions failed to improved cerebral metabolism. HTS showed an additional and stronger effect on cerebral perfusion of potential benefit in the presence of cerebral ischemia. Treatment selection should therefore be individually based on sodium level and cerebral hemodynamics.},

Methods:\hspace{0.6em} COVID-ICU is a multi-center, prospective cohort study conducted in 138 hospitals in France, Belgium, and Switzerland. Demographic, clinical, respiratory support, adjunctive interventions, ICU length-of-stay, and survival data were collected. Results:\hspace{0.6em} From February 25 to May 4, 2020, 4643 patients (median [IQR] age 63 [54\textendash 71] years and SAPS II 37 [28\textendash 50]) were admitted in ICU, with day-90 post-ICU admission status available for 4244. On ICU admission, standard oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, and non-invasive ventilation were applied to 29\%, 19\%, and 6\% patients, respectively. 2635 (63\%) patients were intubated during the first 24 h whereas overall 3376 (80\%) received invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) at one point during their ICU stay. Median (IQR) positive end-expiratory and plateau pressures were 12 (10\textendash 14) \-cmH2O, and 24 (21\textendash 27) \-cmH2O, respectively. The mechanical power transmitted by the MV to the lung was 26.5 (18.6\textendash 34.9) J/min. Paralyzing agents and prone position were applied to 88\% and 70\% of patients intubated at Day-1, respectively.

In this tutorial, we consider methods for extending causal inferences about time-fixed treatments from a trial to a new target population of non-participants, using data from a completed randomized trial and baseline covariate data from a sample from the target population. We examine methods based on modeling the expectation of the outcome, the probability of participation, or both (doubly robust). We compare the methods in a simulation study and show how they can be implemented in software. We apply the methods to a randomized trial nested within a cohort of trial-eligible patients to compare coronary artery surgery plus medical therapy versus medical therapy alone for patients with chronic coronary artery disease. We conclude by discussing issues that arise when using the methods in applied analyses.},

Methods                                Retrospective cohort study using prospective data on adult patients with first-ever acute stroke/TIA from the Australian Stroke Clinical Registry (April 2010 to June 2014), linked with nationwide medication dispensing and                 Medicare                 claims data. Medication users were those with {$\geq$}1 dispensing in the year post-discharge. Discontinuation was assessed among medication users and defined as having no medication supply for {$\geq$}90 days in the year post-discharge. Multivariable competing risks regression, accounting for death during the observation period, was conducted to investigate factors associated with time to medication discontinuation.                                                        Results               Among 17,980 registry patients with stroke/TIA, 91.4\% were linked to administrative datasets. Of these, 9,817 adults with first-ever stroke/TIA were included (45.4\% female, 47.6\% aged {$\geq$}75 years, and 11.4\% intracerebral hemorrhage). While most patients received secondary prevention medications (79.3\% antihypertensive, 81.8\% antithrombotic, and 82.7\% lipid-lowering medication), between one-fifth and one-third discontinued treatment over the subsequent year post-discharge (20.9\% antihypertensive, 34.1\% antithrombotic, and 28.5\% lipid-lowering medications). Prescription at hospital discharge (sub-hazard ratio [SHR]: 0.70; 95\% CI: 0.62\textendash 0.79), quarterly contact with a primary-care physician (SHR: 0.62; 95\% CI: 0.57\textendash 0.67), and prescription by a specialist physician (SHR: 0.87; 95\% CI: 0.77\textendash 0.98) were all inversely associated with antihypertensive discontinuation.                                         Conclusions               Patterns of use of secondary prevention medications after stroke/TIA are not optimal, with many survivors discontinuing treatment within one-year post-discharge. Improving post-discharge care for patients with stroke/TIA is needed to minimize unwarranted discontinuation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conventional angiography is the benchmark examination to diagnose cerebral vasospasm, but there is limited evidence regarding its reliability. Our goals were the following: 1) to systematically review the literature on the reliability of the diagnosis of cerebral vasospasm using conventional angiography, and 2) to perform an agreement study among clinicians who perform endovascular treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles reporting a classification system on the degree of cerebral vasospasm on conventional angiography were systematically searched, and agreement studies were identified. We assembled a portfolio of 221 cases of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and asked 17 raters with different backgrounds (radiology, neurosurgery, or neurology) and experience (junior \#10 and senior .10 years) to independently evaluate cerebral vasospasm in 7 vessel segments using a 3-point scale and to evaluate, for each case, whether findings would justify endovascular treatment. Nine raters took part in the intraobserver reliability study. RESULTS: The systematic review showed a very heterogeneous literature, with 140 studies using 60 different nomenclatures and 21 different thresholds to define cerebral vasospasm, and 5 interobserver studies reporting a wide range of reliability (k {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.14\textendash 0.87). In our study, only senior raters reached substantial agreement (k \$ 0.6) on vasospasm of the supraclinoid ICA, M1, and basilar segments and only when assessments were dichotomized (presence or absence of \$50\% narrowing). Agreement on whether to proceed with endovascular management of vasospasm was only fair (k \# 0.4). CONCLUSIONS: Research on cerebral vasospasm would benefit from standardization of definitions and thresholds. Dichotomized decisions by experienced readers are required for the reliable angiographic diagnosis of cerebral vasospasm.},

  abstract = {Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are increasingly popular in the social sciences, not only in medicine. We argue that the lay public, and sometimes researchers, put too much trust in RCTs over other methods of investigation. Contrary to frequent claims in the applied literature, randomization does not equalize everything other than the treatment in the treatment and control groups, it does not automatically deliver a precise estimate of the average treatment effect (ATE), and it does not relieve us of the need to think about (observed or unobserved) covariates. Finding out whether an estimate was generated by chance is more difficult than commonly believed. At best, an RCT yields an unbiased estimate, but this property is of limited practical value. Even then, estimates apply only to the sample selected for the trial, often no more than a convenience sample, and justification is required to extend the results to other groups, including any population to which the trial sample belongs, or to any individual, including an individual in the trial. Demanding `external validity' is unhelpful because it expects too much of an RCT while undervaluing its potential contribution. RCTs do indeed require minimal assumptions and can operate with little prior knowledge. This is an advantage when persuading distrustful audiences, but it is a disadvantage for cumulative scientific progress, where prior knowledge should be built upon, not discarded. RCTs can play a role in building scientific knowledge and useful predictions but they can only do so as part of a cumulative program, combining with other methods, including conceptual and theoretical development, to discover not `what works', but `why things work'.},

Methods               All patients with stroke treated by thrombectomy (June 2015\textendash October 2018) were prospectively enrolled in this observational study. At 90 days, functional outcome was assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and patient-reported HRQOL was assessed by the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) self-report questionnaire, consisting of 5 health domains. The EQ-5D utility index (EQ-5D-I) score (-0.594 to 1.00, with higher values indicating better HRQOL) was calculated. Linear regression analysis was applied to identify predictors of better HRQOL (higher EQ-5D-I score).                                         Results               Of 504 patients (median age 76 years, 51.8\% female), the mean EQ-5D-I score was 0.39 (SD 0.44). The proportion of stroke survivors who reported complaints in the different domains decreased from 66\% in Usual Activities to 57\% in Mobility, 50.4\% in Self-Care, 41.7\% in Pain/Discomfort, and 40.8\% Anxiety/Depression. Lower age, lower prestroke mRS score, lower baseline NIH Stroke Scale score, higher Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score, concomitant thrombolysis therapy, and a successful recanalization were independent predictors of better HRQOL.                                         Conclusions               Patient-reported HRQOL provides a more comprehensive assessment of stroke outcome than the mRS score. Health domains involving motor function most frequently showed complaints in HRQOL after stroke thrombectomy, while a large proportion of patients did not report any complaints across the different health domains. Predictors of better HRQOL closely match the predictors of better functional outcome measured by the mRS in other thrombectomy studies.},

  abstract = {Background: Decision-making in the acute phase after a severe stroke is complex and may involve life-and-death decisions. Apart from the medical condition and prognosis, quality of life and the deliberation of palliative care should be part of the decision-making process. Relatives play an important role by informing physicians about the patient's values and preferences. However, little is known about how the patients' relatives experience the decision-making process. Aim: To elicit the perspective of relatives of severe stroke patients with regard to the decision-making process in the acute phase in order to understand how they participate in treatment decisions. Design: An exploratory qualitative interview approach guided by the principles of grounded theory. Settings/participants: Relatives of severe stroke patients (n\,=\,15) were interviewed about their experiences in the decision-making process in the acute phase. Results: Four categories reflecting relatives' experiences were identified: (1) making decisions under time pressure, (2) the feeling of `who am I' to decide, (3) reluctance in saying `let her die' and (4) coping with unexpected changes. Following the treatment proposal of the physician was found to be the prevailing tendency of relatives in the decision-making process. Conclusion: A better understanding of the latent world of experiences of relatives that influence the decision-making process may help physicians and other health-care providers to better involve relatives in decision-making and enhance the care, including palliative care, for patients with severe stroke in line with their values and preferences. Communication between physician and relatives seems vital in this process.},

Methods: Associations between ICH sites and poor outcomes (death [6] or major disability [3\textendash 5] of modified Rankin Scale) and European Quality of Life Scale (EQ-5D) utility scores at 90 days were assessed in logistic regression models. Results: Of 2,066 patients included in the analyses, associations were identified between ICH sites and poor outcomes: involvement of posterior limb of internal capsule increased risks of death or major disability (odds ratio [OR] 2.10) and disability (OR 1.81); thalamic involvement increased risks of death or major disability (OR 2.24) and death (OR 1.97). Involvement of the posterior limb of the internal capsule, thalamus, and infratentorial sites were each associated with poor EQ-5D utility score (\#0.7 [median]; OR 1.87, 2.14, and 2.81, respectively). Posterior limb of internal capsule involvement was strongly associated with low scores across all health-related quality of life domains. ICH encompassing the thalamus and posterior limb of internal capsule were associated with death or major disability, major disability, and poor EQ-5D utility score (OR 1.72, 2.26, and 1.71, respectively). Conclusion: Poor clinical outcomes are related to ICH affecting the posterior limb of internal capsule, thalamus, and infratentorial sites. The highest association with death or major disability and poor EQ-5D utility score was seen in ICH encompassing the thalamus and posterior limb of internal capsule.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the certification of stroke centers, the performance of serial nursing neurological assessments and reassessments, commonly known as neurochecks, is often cited as one of the most problematic standards. The role of neurochecks is to readily detect neurological change, but it is surprising that this practice has undergone relatively little scientific study. Their effectiveness in detecting worsening in acute ischemic stroke patients has not been well studied. Our objective was to investigate the sensitivity of neurochecks to detect neurological deterioration after acute ischemic stroke. We performed a retrospective chart review of patients with acute ischemic stroke who were admitted to a comprehensive stroke center over a 2-year period and who received intravenous thrombolysis. The incidence, reasons, and detection rates for neurological deterioration by neurochecks were collected during the first 72 hours of admission. RESULTS: A total of 231 patient records were reviewed. Over the first 72 hours of admission, each patient had a mean of 63{$\pm$}15 neurochecks. Neurological worsening as determined by a stroke neurologist was found in 62 (27\%) patients. This deterioration was first detected by a scheduled neurocheck in 28 (45\%) patients and was discovered by the nurse outside of a scheduled neurocheck in 16 (26\%) patients. In 18 out of 62 (29\%) patients, the worsening was not detected. CONCLUSIONS: Although neurochecks detected neurological deterioration in almost half of patients with acute stroke, a significant proportion of deteriorations were found outside scheduled assessments or remained undetected. This suggests that novel monitoring strategies are needed to readily identify worsening neurological status in acute stroke.},

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS This is a retrospective review of 2018 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oncology drug approvals with estimation of the eligible population. The cost of new therapy was estimated, and savings from displaced therapies were subtracted. Two-way sensitivity analysis explored uncertainty in pricing and market diffusion. Data were collected between March 1, 2019, and September 30, 2019. EXPOSURES Data related to the cancer drug approval (ie, indications, approval pathway, basis for approval), cancer incidence, and drug price were extracted from publicly available sources, including the FDA, National Cancer Institute, and American Cancer Society websites, as well as the RED BOOK database. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the projected net expenditure in the US associated with the new therapies. The secondary outcome described how variable market diffusion and pricing permit expected levels of spending. RESULTS A total of 46 oncology approvals were included in the analysis, with 17 novel drugs and 29 new indications. The average price per patient per treatment course was \$150 384. From a national perspective and with 100\% market diffusion, the projected net expenditure for newly approved drugs was \$39.5 billion per year. To maintain the recent trend of cancer drug spending, the 2018 cancer drug approvals need to be used in fewer than 20\% of eligible patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE New cancer drugs approved by the FDA in 2018 would drastically increase cancer drug spending in the US if used widely. Alternatively, only low-level use of the new drugs is consistent with market forecasting.},

  abstract = {Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage is a devastating disease, accounting for 10 to 15\% of all types of stroke; however, it is associated with disproportionally higher rates of mortality and disability. Despite significant progress in the acute management of these patients, the ideal surgical management is still to be determined. Surgical hematoma drainage has many theoretical benefits, such as the prevention of mass effect and cerebral herniation, reduction in intracranial pressure, and the decrease of excitotoxicity and neurotoxicity of blood products., Several surgical techniques have been considered, such as open craniotomy, decompressive craniectomy, neuroendoscopy, and minimally invasive catheter evacuation followed by thrombolysis. Open craniotomy is the most studied approach in this clinical scenario, the first randomized controlled trial dating from the early 1960s. Since then, a large number of studies have been published, which included two large, well-designed, well-powered, multicenter, multinational, randomized clinical trials. These studies, The International Surgical Trial in Intracerebral Hemorrhage (STICH), and the STICH II have shown no clinical benefit for early surgical evacuation of intraparenchymal hematoma in patients with spontaneous supratentorial hemorrhage when compared with best medical management plus delayed surgery if necessary. However, the results of STICH trials may not be generalizable, because of the high rates of patients' crossover from medical management to the surgical group. Without these high crossover percentages, the rates of unfavorable outcome and death with conservative management would have been higher. Additionally, comatose patients and patients at risk of cerebral herniation were not included. In these cases, surgery may be lifesaving, which prevented those patients of being enrolled in such trials. This article reviews the clinical evidence of surgical hematoma evacuation, and its role to decrease mortality and improve long-term functional outcome after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose: Although neurologists consider intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to be standard of care in the treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke, its use remains contentious within the broader medical community, and particularly among emergency physicians. Why might this be? We provide a historical context to this ongoing controversy by reviewing how neurologists have conceptualized the acute stroke and its treatment, with the aim of bridging this gap. Methods: Based on historical sources in the Mackie Family History of Neuroscience Collection at the University of Calgary, as well as online resources, we trace the evolution of the concept of the ``acute stroke,'' which has come to mean a stroke that is potentially treatable with tPA. We frame this conceptualization in relation to historical ``building blocks'' in anatomy, pathology, and physiology. We then use these building blocks to explain why neurologists understand tPA to be effective and why emergency physicians often do not. Results and Conclusions: Arguments against the use of tPA reiterate 20-year-old concerns about its efficacy and safety. We believe these persistent concerns can be framed as a lack of understanding of the ``building blocks'' upon which neurologists' conception of tPA is built. Our view suggests that the way forward to bridge the gap between neurology and other disciplines is not to conduct more trials but to offer a shared conceptualization of the trials already completed and of the intellectual tradition from which they emerged.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is associated with diffuse lung damage. Glucocorticoids may modulate inflammation-mediated lung injury and thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death. METHODS In this controlled, open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Here, we report the preliminary results of this comparison. RESULTS A total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care. Overall, 482 patients (22.9\%) in the dexamethasone group and 1110 patients (25.7\%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.93; P{$<$}0.001). The proportional and absolute between-group differences in mortality varied considerably according to the level of respiratory support that the patients were receiving at the time of randomization. In the dexamethasone group, the incidence of death was lower than that in the usual care group among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.3\% vs. 41.4\%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95\% CI, 0.51 to 0.81) and among those receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3\% vs. 26.2\%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) but not among those who were receiving no respiratory support at randomization (17.8\% vs. 14.0\%; rate ratio, 1.19; 95\% CI, 0.91 to 1.55). CONCLUSIONS In patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization but not among those receiving no respiratory support.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence and magnitude of between-center and between-country differences in outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).                                         METHODS               The authors analyzed data from 5972 aSAH patients enrolled in randomized clinical trials of 3 different treatments from the Subarachnoid Hemorrhage International Trialists (SAHIT) repository, including data from 179 centers and 20 countries. They used random effects logistic regression adjusted for patient characteristics and timing of aneurysm treatment to estimate between-center and between-country differences in unfavorable outcome, defined as a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1\textendash 3 (severe disability, vegetative state, or death) or modified Rankin Scale score of 4\textendash 6 (moderately severe disability, severe disability, or death) at 3 months. Between-center and between-country differences were quantified with the median odds ratio (MOR), which can be interpreted as the ratio of odds of unfavorable outcome between a typical high-risk and a typical low-risk center or country.                                         RESULTS               The proportion of patients with unfavorable outcome was 27\% (n = 1599). The authors found substantial between-center differences (MOR 1.26, 95\% CI 1.16\textendash 1.52), which could not be explained by patient characteristics and timing of aneurysm treatment (adjusted MOR 1.21, 95\% CI 1.11\textendash 1.44).

CONCLUSIONS               Clinical outcomes after aSAH differ between centers. These differences could not be explained by patient characteristics or timing of aneurysm treatment.

Background The utility of specialty ICUs is debated. From a cost perspective, having fewer larger ICUs is preferred. Alternatively, the impact of specialty ICUs on patient outcome is unknown. Patients with ICH are admitted routinely to both general and neuro ICUs and provide an opportunity to address this question. Setting Forty-two neuro, medical, surgical, and medical-surgical ICUs. Measurements and Main Results The study was an analysis of data prospectively collected by Project Impact over 3 yrs from 42 participating ICUs (including one neuro ICU) across the country. The records of 36,986 patients were merged with records of 3,298 patients from a second neuro ICU that collected the same data over the same period. The impact of clinical (age, race, gender, Glasgow Coma Scale score, reason for admission, insurance), ICU (size, number of ICH patients, full-time intensivist, clinical service, American College for Graduate Medical Education or Critical Care Medicine fellowship), and institutional (size, location, medical school affiliation) characteristics on hospital mortality rate of ICH patients was assessed by using a forward-enter multivariate analysis. Data from 1,038 patients were included. The 13 ICUs that admitted {$>$}20 patients accounted for 83\% of the admissions with a mortality rate that ranged from 25\% to 64\%. Multivariate analysis adjusted for patient demographics, severity of ICH, and ICU and institutional characteristics indicated that not being in a neuro ICU was associated with an increase in hospital mortality rate (odds ratio [OR], 3.4; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.65\textendash 7.6). Other factors associated with higher mortality rate were greater age (OR, 1.03/year; 95\% CI, 1.01\textendash 1.04), lower Glasgow Coma Scale score (OR, 0.6/point; 95\% CI, 0.58\textendash 0.65), fewer ICH patients (OR, 1.01/patient; 95\% CI, 1.00\textendash 1.01), and smaller ICU (OR, 1.1/bed; 95\% CI, 1.02\textendash 1.13). Having a full time intensivist was associated with lower mortality rate (OR, 0.388; 95\% CI, 0.22\textendash 0.67). Conclusions For patients with acute ICH, admission to a neuro vs. general ICU is associated with reduced mortality rate.}

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Early systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction is believed to improve outcome after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but there has been a limited assessment of SBP trajectories in individual patients. We aimed to determine the prognostic significance of SBP trajectories in ICH. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We collected routine data on spontaneous ICH patients from two healthcare systems over 10 years. Unsupervised functional principal components analysis (FPCA) was used to characterize SBP trajectories over first 24 h and their relationship to the primary outcome of unfavorable shift on modified Rankin scale (mRS) at hospital discharge, categorized as an ordinal trichotomous variable (mRS 0\textendash 2, 3\textendash 4, and 5\textendash 6 defined as good, poor, and severe, respectively). Ordinal logistic regression models adjusted for baseline SBP and ICH volume were used to determine the prognostic significance of SBP trajectories. Results:\hspace{0.6em} The 757 patients included in the study were 65\,{$\pm$}\,23 years old, 56\% were men, with a median (IQR) Glasgow come scale of 14 (8). FPCA revealed that mean SBP over 24 h and SBP reduction within the first 6 h accounted for 76.8\% of the variation in SBP trajectories. An increase in SBP reduction (per 10 mmHg) was significantly associated with unfavorable outcomes defined as mRS\,{$>$}\,2 (adjusted-OR\,=\,1.134; 95\% CI 1.044\textendash 1.233, P\,=\,0.003). Compared with SBP reduction\,{$<$}\,20 mmHg, worse outcomes were observed for SBP reduction\,=\,40\textendash 60 mmHg (adjusted-OR\,=\,1.940, 95\% CI 1.129\textendash 3.353, P\,=\,0.017) and\,{$>$}\,60 mmHg, (adjusted-OR\,=\,1.965, 95\% CI 1.011, 3.846, P\,=\,0.047). Furthermore, the association of SBP reduction and outcome varied according to initial hematoma volume. Smaller SBP reduction was associated with good outcome (mRS 0\textendash 2) in small ({$<$}\,7.42 mL) and medium-size ({$\geq$}\,7.42 and\,{$<$}\,30.47 mL) hematomas. Furthermore, while the likelihood of good outcome was low in those with large hematomas ({$\geq$}\,30.47 mL), smaller SBP reduction was associated with decreasing probability of severe outcome (mRS 5\textendash 6). Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} Our analyses suggest that in the first 6 h SBP reduction is significantly associated with the in-hospital outcome that varies with initial hematoma volume, and early SBP reduction\,{$>$}\,40 mmHg may be harmful in ICH patients. For early SBP reduction to have an effective therapeutic effect, both target levels and optimum SBP reduction goals vis-\`a-vis hematoma volume should be considered.},

  abstract = {Objective: In clinical trials, the relative risk or risk ratio (RR) is a mainstay of reporting of the effect magnitude for an intervention. The RR is the ratio of the probability of an outcome in an intervention group to its probability in a control group. Thus the RR provides a measure of change in the likelihood of an event linked to a given intervention. This measure has been widely used because it is today considered a measure with `portability' across varying outcome prevalence, especially when the outcome is rare. It turns out however that there is a much more important problem with this ratio, and this paper aims to demonstrate this problem. Methods: We used mathematical derivation to determine if the RR is a measure of effect magnitude alone (i.e. a larger absolute value always indicating a stronger effect) or not. We also used the same Journal Pre-proof derivation to determine its relationship to prevalence of an outcome. We confirm the derivation results with a follow-up analysis of 140,620 trials scraped from the Cochrane. Results: We demonstrate that the RR varies for reasons other than magnitude of the effect because it is a ratio of two posterior probabilities, both of which are dependent on baseline prevalence of an outcome. Additionally we demonstrate that the RR shifts towards its null value with increasing outcome prevalence. The shift towards the null happens regardless of the strength of the association between intervention and outcome. The odds ratio (OR), the other commonly used ratio, measures solely the effect magnitude and has no relationship to prevalence of an outcome in a study nor does it overestimate the RR as is commonly thought. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the need to a) end the primary use of the RR in clinical trials and meta-analyses as its direct interpretation is not meaningful; b) replace the RR by the OR; and c) only use the post-intervention risk recalculated from the OR for any expected level of baseline risk in absolute terms for purposes of interpretation such as the number needed to treat. These results will have far reaching implications such as reducing misleading results from clinical trials and meta-analyses and ushering in a new era in the reporting of such trials or meta-analyses in practice.},

Historically considered a result of head trauma, recent evidence suggests there are more complex processes involved. Trauma may be absent or very minor and does not explain the progressive, chronic course of the condition. This review focuses on several key processes involved in CSDH development: angiogenesis, fibrinolysis and inflammation. The characteristic membrane surrounding the CSDH has been identified as a source of fluid exudation and haemorrhage. Angiogenic stimuli lead to the creation of fragile blood vessels within membrane walls, whilst fibrinolytic processes prevent clot formation resulting in continued haemorrhage. An abundance of inflammatory cells and markers have been identified within the membranes and subdural fluid and are likely to contribute to propagating an inflammatory response which stimulates ongoing membrane growth and fluid accumulation. Currently, the mainstay of treatment for CSDH is surgical drainage, which has associated risks of recurrence requiring repeat surgery. Understanding of the underlying pathophysiological processes has been applied to developing potential drug treatments. Ongoing research is needed to identify if these therapies are successful in controlling the inflammatory and angiogenic disease processes leading to control and resolution of CSDH.},

Advanced neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques have revealed new insights into the biological mechanisms underlying recovery of consciousness and have enabled the identification of preserved brain networks in patients who seem unresponsive, thus raising hope for more accurate diagnosis and prognosis. Emerging evidence suggests that covert consciousness, or cognitive motor dissociation (CMD), is present in up to 15\textendash 20\% of patients with DoC and that detection of CMD in the intensive care unit can predict functional recovery at 1\,year post injury. Although fundamental questions remain about which patients with DoC have the potential for recovery, novel pharmacological and electrophysiological therapies have shown the potential to reactivate injured neural networks and promote re-emergence of consciousness.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Open-label randomized clinical trial of 5302 patients undergoing PCI for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients were enrolled at 40 centers in the US, Canada, South Korea, and Mexico from May 2013 through October 2018; final date of follow-up was October 2019. INTERVENTIONS Patients randomized to the genotype-guided group (n = 2652) underwent point-of-care genotyping. CYP2C19 LOF carriers were prescribed ticagrelor and noncarriers clopidogrel. Patients randomized to the conventional group (n = 2650) were prescribed clopidogrel and underwent genotyping after 12 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, stent thrombosis, and severe recurrent ischemia at 12 months. A secondary end point was major or minor bleeding at 12 months. The primary analysis was in patients with CYP2C19 LOF variants, and secondary analysis included all randomized patients. The trial had 85\% power to detect a minimum hazard ratio of 0.50. RESULTS Among 5302 patients randomized (median age, 62 years; 25\% women), 82\% had ACS and 18\% had stable CAD; 94\% completed the trial. Of 1849 with CYP2C19 LOF variants, 764 of 903 (85\%) assigned to genotype-guided therapy received ticagrelor, and 932 of 946 (99\%) assigned to conventional therapy received clopidogrel. The primary end point occurred in 35 of 903 CYP2C19 LOF carriers (4.0\%) in the genotype-guided therapy group and 54 of 946 (5.9\%) in the conventional therapy group at 12 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [95\% CI, 0.43-1.02]; P = .06). None of the 11 prespecified secondary end points showed significant differences, including major or minor bleeding in CYP2C19 LOF carriers in the genotype-guided group (1.9\%) vs the conventional therapy group (1.6\%) at 12 months (HR, 1.22 [95\% CI, 0.60-2.51]; P = .58).

A total of 13 078 patients were randomized at 675 academic and community hospitals in 22 countries in North America, Europe, South America, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to receive 4 g/d of omega-3 CA (n = 6539) or corn oil, which was intended to serve as an inert comparator (n = 6539), in addition to usual background therapies, including statins. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary efficacy measure was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization. RESULTS When 1384 patients had experienced a primary end point event (of a planned 1600 events), the trial was prematurely halted based on an interim analysis that indicated a low probability of clinical benefit of omega-3 CA vs the corn oil comparator. Among the 13 078 treated patients (mean [SD] age, 62.5 [9.0] years; 35\% women; 70\% with diabetes; median low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol level, 75.0 mg/dL; median triglycerides level, 240 mg/dL; median HDL-C level, 36 mg/dL; and median high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level, 2.1 mg/L), 12 633 (96.6\%) completed the trial with ascertainment of primary end point status.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether hydrocortisone improves outcome for patients with severe COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS An ongoing adaptive platform trial testing multiple interventions within multiple therapeutic domains, for example, antiviral agents, corticosteroids, or immunoglobulin. Between March 9 and June 17, 2020, 614 adult patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled and randomized within at least 1 domain following admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory or cardiovascular organ support at 121 sites in 8 countries. Of these, 403 were randomized to open-label interventions within the corticosteroid domain. The domain was halted after results from another trial were released. Follow-up ended August 12, 2020. INTERVENTIONS The corticosteroid domain randomized participants to a fixed 7-day course of intravenous hydrocortisone (50 mg or 100 mg every 6 hours) (n = 143), a shock-dependent course (50 mg every 6 hours when shock was clinically evident) (n = 152), or no hydrocortisone (n = 108). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was organ support\textendash free days (days alive and free of ICU-based respiratory or cardiovascular support) within 21 days, where patients who died were assigned \textendash 1 day. The primary analysis was a bayesian cumulative logistic model that included all patients enrolled with severe COVID-19, adjusting for age, sex, site, region, time, assignment to interventions within other domains, and domain and intervention eligibility. Superiority was defined as the posterior probability of an odds ratio greater than 1 (threshold for trial conclusion of superiority {$>$}99\%). RESULTS After excluding 19 participants who withdrew consent, there were 384 patients (mean age, 60 years; 29\% female) randomized to the fixed-dose (n = 137), shock-dependent (n = 146), and no (n = 101) hydrocortisone groups; 379 (99\%) completed the study and were included in the analysis. The mean age for the 3 groups ranged between 59.5 and 60.4 years; most patients were male (range, 70.6\%-71.5\%); mean body mass index ranged between 29.7 and 30.9; and patients receiving mechanical ventilation ranged between 50.0\% and 63.5\%. For the fixed-dose, shock-dependent, and no hydrocortisone groups, respectively, the median organ support\textendash free days were 0 (IQR, \textendash 1 to 15), 0 (IQR, \textendash 1 to 13), and 0 (\textendash 1 to 11) days (composed of 30\%, 26\%, and 33\% mortality rates and 11.5, 9.5, and 6 median organ support\textendash free days among survivors). The median adjusted odds ratio and bayesian probability of superiority were 1.43 (95\% credible interval, 0.91-2.27) and 93\% for fixed-dose hydrocortisone, respectively, and were 1.22 (95\% credible interval, 0.76-1.94) and 80\% for shock-dependent hydrocortisone compared with no hydrocortisone. Serious adverse events were reported in 4 (3\%), 5 (3\%), and 1 (1\%) patients in the fixed-dose, shock-dependent, and no hydrocortisone groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with severe COVID-19, treatment with a 7-day fixed-dose course of hydrocortisone or shock-dependent dosing of hydrocortisone, compared with no hydrocortisone, resulted in 93\% and 80\% probabilities of superiority with regard to the odds of improvement in organ support\textendash free days within 21 days. However, the trial was stopped early and no treatment strategy met prespecified criteria for statistical superiority, precluding definitive conclusions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of early tocilizumab administration vs standard therapy in preventing clinical worsening in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective, open-label, randomized clinical trial that randomized patients hospitalized between March 31 and June 11, 2020, with COVID-19 pneumonia to receive tocilizumab or standard of care in 24 hospitals in Italy. Cases of COVID-19 were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction method with nasopharyngeal swab. Eligibility criteria included COVID-19 pneumonia documented by radiologic imaging, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FIO2) ratio between 200 and 300 mm Hg, and an inflammatory phenotype defined by fever and elevated C-reactive protein. INTERVENTIONS Patients in the experimental arm received intravenous tocilizumab within 8 hours from randomization (8 mg/kg up to a maximum of 800 mg), followed by a second dose after 12 hours. Patients in the control arm received supportive care following the protocols of each clinical center until clinical worsening and then could receive tocilizumab as a rescue therapy. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES The primary composite outcome was defined as entry into the intensive care unit with invasive mechanical ventilation, death from all causes, or clinical aggravation documented by the finding of a PaO2/FIO2 ratio less than 150 mm Hg, whichever came first. RESULTS A total of 126 patients were randomized (60 to the tocilizumab group; 66 to the control group). The median (interquartile range) age was 60.0 (53.0-72.0) years, and the majority of patients were male (77 of 126, 61.1\%). Three patients withdrew from the study, leaving 123 patients available for the intention-to-treat analyses. Seventeen patients of 60 (28.3\%) in the tocilizumab arm and 17 of 63 (27.0\%) in the standard care group showed clinical worsening within 14 days since randomization (rate ratio, 1.05; 95\% CI, 0.59-1.86). Two patients in the experimental group and 1 in the control group died before 30 days from randomization, and 6 and 5 patients were intubated in the 2 groups, respectively. The trial was prematurely interrupted after an interim analysis for futility. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this randomized clinical trial of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and PaO2/FIO2 ratio between 200 and 300 mm Hg who received tocilizumab, no benefit on disease progression was observed compared with standard care. Further blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the results and to evaluate possible applications of tocilizumab in different stages of the disease.},

However, guidelines do not distinguish between the different types of buffered solutions. The aim of this scoping review was to assess the evidence on the use of lactate- vs acetate-buffered crystalloid solutions and their potential benefits and harms. Methods: We conducted this scoping review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews. We searched PubMed, Embase, Epistemonikos, and the Cochrane Library for studies assessing the effect of lactate- vs acetate-buffered crystalloid solutions on any outcome in adult hospitalised patients. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Results: We included a total of 29 studies, 25 of which were clinical trials and four were observational studies. Most studies were conducted in surgical settings and indications for use were poorly described. The most commonly administered solutions were Ringer's lactate vs Ringer's acetate or Plasma-Lyte\texttrademark. Outcomes included acid/base and electrolyte status; haemodynamic variables; and markers of renal and liver function, metabolism, and coagulation. Only a few studies reported patient-centred outcomes. Overall, the data provided no firm evidence for benefit or harm of either solution, and the quantity and quality of evidence were low. Conclusions: The quantity and quality of evidence on the use of different buffered crystalloid intravenous solutions were low, data were derived primarily from surgical settings, and patient-important outcomes were rarely reported; thus, the balance between benefits and harms between these solutions is largely unknown.},

  abstract = {Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) might yet transform the statistical modelling of observational data for causal inference. This is because they offer a principled approach to analytical design that draws on existing contextual, empirical and theoretical knowledge, but ultimately relies on temporality alone to objectively specify probabilistic causal relationships amongst measured (and unmeasured) covariates, and the associated exposure and outcome variables. While a working knowledge of phenomenology, critical realism and epistemology seem likely to be useful for mastering the application of DAGs, drawing a DAG appears to require limited technical expertise and might therefore be accessible to even inexperienced and novice analysts. The present study evaluated the inclusion of a novel four-task directed learning exercise for medical undergraduates, which culminated in temporality-driven covariate classification, followed by DAG specification itself. The exercise achieved high levels of student engagement, although the proportion of students completing each of the exercise's four key tasks declined from close to 100\% in tasks 1 and 2 (exposure and outcome specification; and covariate selection) to 83.5\% and 77.6\% in the third and fourth tasks, respectively. Fewer than 15\% of the students successfully classified all of their covariates (as confounders, mediators or competing exposures) using temporality-driven classification, but this improved to more than 35\% following DAG specification \textendash{} an unexpected result given that all of the DAGs displayed at least one substantive technical error. These findings suggest that drawing a DAG, in and of itself, increases the utility of temporality-driven covariate classification for causal inference analysis; although further research is required to better understand: why even poorly specified DAGs might reduce covariate misclassification; how `wrong but useful' DAGs might be identified; and how these marginal benefits might be enhanced with or without improvements in DAG specification.},

This approach involves adjustments of cardiac preload, afterload, and contractility to balance oxygen delivery with oxygen demand. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of early goal-directed therapy before admission to the intensive care unit. Methods We randomly assigned patients who arrived at an urban emergency department with severe sepsis or septic shock to receive either six hours of early goal-directed therapy or standard therapy (as a control) before admission to the intensive care unit. Clinicians who subsequently assumed the care of the patients were blinded to the treatment assignment. In-hospital mortality (the primary efficacy outcome), end points with respect to resuscitation, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores were obtained serially for 72 hours and compared between the study groups. Results Of the 263 enrolled patients, 130 were randomly assigned to early goal-directed therapy and 133 to standard therapy; there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to base-line characteristics. In-hospital mortality was 30.5 percent in the group assigned to early goal-directed therapy, as compared with 46.5 percent in the group assigned to standard therapy (P=0.009). During the interval from 7 to 72 hours, the patients assigned to early goaldirected therapy had a significantly higher mean ({$\pm$}SD) central venous oxygen saturation (70.4{$\pm$}10.7 percent vs. 65.3{$\pm$}11.4 percent), a lower lactate concentration (3.0{$\pm$}4.4 vs. 3.9{$\pm$}4.4 mmol per liter), a lower base deficit (2.0{$\pm$}6.6 vs. 5.1{$\pm$}6.7 mmol per liter), and a higher pH (7.40{$\pm$}0.12 vs. 7.36{$\pm$}0.12) than the patients assigned to standard therapy (P\guillemotleft 0.02 for all comparisons). During the same period, mean APACHE II scores were significantly lower, indicating less severe organ dysfunction, in the patients assigned to early goal-directed therapy than in those assigned to standard therapy (13.0{$\pm$}6.3 vs. 15.9{$\pm$}6.4, P{$<$}0.001).

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To compare the results of prognostic parameters after cardiac arrest (CA) with the histopathologically determined severity of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) obtained from autopsy results. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In a retrospective, 3-center cohort study of all patients who died following cardiac arrest during their intensive care unit stay and underwent autopsy between 2003 and 2015, postmortem brain histopathologic findings were compared with post-CA brain computed tomographic imaging, electroencephalographic (EEG) findings, somatosensory-evoked potentials, and serum neuron-specific enolase levels obtained during the intensive care unit stay. Data analysis was conducted from 2015 to 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The severity of HIE was evaluated according to the selective eosinophilic neuronal death (SEND) classification and patients were dichotomized into categories of histopathologically severe and no/mild HIE. RESULTS Of 187 included patients, 117 were men (63\%) and median age was 65 (interquartile range, 58-74) years. Severe HIE was found in 114 patients (61\%) and no/mild HIE was identified in 73 patients (39\%). Severe HIE was found in all 21 patients with bilaterally absent somatosensory-evoked potentials, all 15 patients with gray-white matter ratio less than 1.10 on brain computed tomographic imaging, all 9 patients with suppressed EEG, 15 of 16 patients with burst-suppression EEG, and all 29 patients with neuron-specific enolase levels greater than 67 {$\mu$}g/L more than 48 hours after CA without confounders. Three of 7 patients with generalized periodic discharges on suppressed background and 1 patient with burst-suppression EEG had a SEND 1 score ({$<$}30\% dead neurons) in the cerebral cortex, but higher SEND scores ({$>$}30\% dead neurons) in other oxygen-sensitive brain regions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, histopathologic findings suggested severe HIE after cardiac arrest in patients with bilaterally absent cortical somatosensory-evoked potentials, gray-white matter ratio less than 1.10, highly malignant EEG, and serum neuron-specific enolase concentration greater than 67 {$\mu$}g/L.},

This review discusses current diagnostic, therapeutic, and process models that can expedite stroke treatment to achieve best outcomes. Use of stent retrievers after selection via advanced imaging is safe and effective, and is an important option for AIS patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO). Significant time delays occur before and during patient transfers, and upon comprehensive stroke center (CSC) arrival, and have deleterious effects on functional outcome. Removing obstacles, enhancing inter-facility communication, and creating acute stroke management processes and protocols are paramount strategies to enhance network efficiency. Inter-departmental CSC collaboration can significantly reduce door-to-treatment times. Streamlined stroke systems of care may result in higher treatment rates and better functional outcomes for AIS patients, simultaneously conserving healthcare dollars. Stroke systems of care should be structured regionally to minimize time to treatment. A proactive approach must be employed; a management plan incorporating stroke team prenotification and parallel processes between departments can save valuable time, maximize brain salvage, and reduce disability from stroke.}

  abstract = {Objective: To examine the long-term prognosis in patients with `malignant' supratentorial ischemia of the right hemisphere treated with hemicraniectomy, especially in respect to depression, with a focus on age as a possible predictor of outcome. Methods: We performed a prospective, long-term, follow-up examination in 23 survivors of 32 patients (mortality 28.1\%) treated with hemicraniectomy for malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction of the right hemisphere, who were identified in our data bank since 1993. Long-term was defined as at least 20 months after craniectomy. Outcome data consisted of the items functionality, depression and quality of life. Tests applied included the Barthel Index (BI), the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and stroke-specific quality of life (QoL) scale. Results: Of the 23 patients 15 (65.2\%) had a BI {$\geq$} 60, 11 (47.8\%) a mRS {$<$} 4 and 9 (39.1\%) a SS-QOL {$\geq$} 60\%, each representing a favourable outcome. In retrospect, 14 (60.9\%) patients approved the surgery. Depression, i.e. a BDI {$>$} 9, was diagnosed in 13 (56.5\%) patients and 5 (38.5\%) of them were treated with antidepressants. In a multiple linear regression analysis age at craniectomy was a predictor of a low BI (beta = -0.863; p = 0.031), but not of the other outcome parameters. Conclusions: Depression is a common and rarely treated long-term complication after `malignant' right hemispheric ischemia. While high age is a strong predictor of poor functional outcome, it has no impact on depression and retrospective approval of craniectomy. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Methods               Patients in vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS) or in minimally conscious state (MCS) were enrolled within 3 months from their brain injury in 12 specialized medical institutions. Demographic, anamnestic, clinical, and neurophysiologic data were collected at study entry. Patients were then followed up for assessing the primary outcome, that is, clinical diagnosis according to standardized criteria at 6 months postinjury.                                         Results               We enrolled 147 patients (44 women; mean age 49.4 [95\% confidence interval 46.1\textendash 52.6] years; VS/UWS 71, MCS 76; traumatic 55, vascular 56, anoxic 36; mean time postinjury 59.6 [55.4\textendash 63.6] days).

Conclusions               Multimodal assessment could identify patients with higher likelihood of clinical improvement in order to help clinicians, families, and funding sources with various aspects of decision-making. This multicenter, international study aims to stimulate further research that drives international consensus regarding standardization of prognostic procedures for patients with DoC.},

  abstract = {As it is often assumed that delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is caused by vasospasm, clinical trials often focus on prevention of vasospasm with the aim to improve clinical outcome. However, the role of vasospasm in the pathogenesis of DCI and clinical outcome is possibly smaller than previously assumed. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on all randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that studied the effect of pharmaceutical preventive strategies on vasospasm, DCI, and clinical outcome in SAH patients to further investigate the relationship between vasospasm and clinical outcome. Effect sizes were expressed in pooled risk ratio (RR) estimates with corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CI). A total of 14 studies randomizing 4,235 patients were included. Despite a reduction of vasospasm (RR 0.80 (95\% CI 0.70 to 0.92)), no statistically significant effect on poor outcome was observed (RR 0.93 (95\% CI 0.85 to 1.03)). The variety of DCI definitions did not justify pooling the DCI data. We conclude that pharmaceutical treatments have significantly decreased the incidence of vasospasm, but not of poor clinical outcome. This dissociation between vasospasm and clinical outcome could result from methodological problems, sample size, insensitivity of clinical outcome measures, or from mechanisms other than vasospasm that also contribute to poor outcome.},

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data of 451 ICH patients between 2010-2018. The sample was randomly divided in a development and a validation cohort. Logistic regression was used to develop a risk score by weighting independent predictors of ICU needs based on strength of association. The risk score was tested in the validation cohort, and externally validated in a dataset from another institution. Results: The rate of ICU interventions was 80.3\%. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and ICH volume were independent predictors of critical care, resulting in the following point assignments for the INtensive care TRiaging IN Spontaneous IntraCerebral hemorrhage (INTRINSIC) score: SBP 160-190 mm Hg (1 point), SBP {$>$}190 mm Hg (3 points); GCS 8-13 (1 point), GCS {$<$}8 (3 points); ICH volume 16-40 cm3 (1 point), ICH volume {$>$}40 cm3 (2 points); and presence of IVH (1 point), with values ranging between 0-9. Among patients with a score of 0 and no ICU needs during their emergency department stay, 93.6\% remained without critical care needs. In an external validation cohort of ICH patients, the INTRINSIC score achieved an AUC of 0.823 (95\% CI 0.782-0.863). A score {$<$}2 predicted absence of critical care needs with 48.5\% sensitivity and 88.5\% specificity, and a score {$<$}3 predicted absence of critical care needs with 61.7\% sensitivity and 83.0\% specificity. Conclusion: The INTRINSIC score identifies ICH patients at low risk for critical care interventions. Classification of Evidence: This study provides Class II evidence that the INTRINSIC score identifies ICH patients at low risk for critical care interventions.},

Concerns about traditional RCT models are legitimate, but randomization remains a critical tool to understand the causal relationship between treatments and outcomes.

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Levetiracetam is commonly used for seizure prophylaxis in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), traumatic brain injury (TBI), supratentorial neurosurgery, and spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). However, its efficacy, optimal dosing, and the adverse events associated with levetiracetam prophylaxis remain unclear. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane central register of controlled trials (CENTRAL) database was conducted from January 1, 2000, to October 30, 2020, including articles addressing treatment with levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis after SAH, ICH, TBI, and supratentorial neurosurgery. Non-English, pediatric (aged\,{$<$}\,18 years), preclinical, reviews, case reports, and articles that included patients with a preexisting seizure condition or epilepsy were excluded. The coprimary meta-analyses examined first seizure events in (1) levetiracetam versus no antiseizure medication and (2) levetiracetam versus other antiseizure medications in all ICH, TBI, SAH, and supratentorial neurosurgery populations. Secondary meta-analyses evaluated the same comparator groups in individual disease populations. Risk of bias in non-randomised studies - of interventions (ROBINS-I) and risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB-2) tools were used to assess risk of bias. Results:\hspace{0.6em} A total of 30 studies (n\,=\,6 randomized trials, n\,=\,9 prospective studies, and n\,=\,15 retrospective studies), including 7609 patients (n\,=\,4737 with TBI, n\,=\,701 with SAH, n\,=\,261 with ICH, and n\,=\,1910 with neurosurgical diseases) were included in analyses. Twenty-seven of 30 (90\%) studies demonstrated moderate to severe risk of bias, and 11 of 30 (37\%) studies used low-dosage levetiracetam (250\textendash 500 mg twice daily). In the primary meta-analyses, there were no differences in seizure events for levetiracetam prophylaxis (n\,=\,906) versus no antiseizure medication (n\,=\,2728; odds ratio [OR] 0.79, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.53\textendash 1.16, P\,=\,0.23, fixed-effect, I2\,=\,26\%, P\,=\,0.23 for heterogeneity) or levetiracetam (n\,=\,1950) versus other antiseizure prophylaxis (n\,=\,2289; OR 0.84, 95\% CI 0.55\textendash 1.28, P\,=\,0.41, random-effects, I2\,=\,49\%, P\,=\,0.005 for heterogeneity). Only patients with supratentorial neurosurgical diseases benefited from levetiracetam compared with other antiseizure medications (median 0.70 seizure events perpatient-year with levetiracetam versus 2.20 seizure events per-patient-year for other antiseizure medications, OR 0.34, 95\% CI 0.20\textendash 0.58, P\,{$<$}\,0.001, fixed-effects, I2\,=\,39\%, P\,=\,0.13 for heterogeneity). There were no significant differences in meta-analyses of patients with ICH, SAH, or TBI.

  abstract = {Background Previous trials suggesting that high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) reduced mortality among adults with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were limited by the use of outdated comparator ventilation strategies and small sample sizes. Methods In a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial conducted at 39 intensive care units in five countries, we randomly assigned adults with new-onset, moderate-to-severe ARDS to HFOV targeting lung recruitment or to a control ventilation strategy targeting lung recruitment with the use of low tidal volumes and high positive end-expiratory pressure. The primary outcome was the rate of in-hospital death from any cause. Results On the recommendation of the data monitoring committee, we stopped the trial after 548 of a planned 1200 patients had undergone randomization. The two study groups were well matched at baseline. The HFOV group underwent HFOV for a median of 3 days (interquartile range, 2 to 8); in addition, 34 of 273 patients (12\%) in the control group received HFOV for refractory hypoxemia. In-hospital mortality was 47\% in the HFOV group, as compared with 35\% in the control group (relative risk of death with HFOV, 1.33; 95\% confidence interval, 1.09 to 1.64; P\,=\,0.005). This finding was independent of baseline abnormalities in oxygenation or respiratory compliance. Patients in the HFOV group received higher doses of midazolam than did patients in the control group (199 mg per day [interquartile range, 100 to 382] vs. 141 mg per day [interquartile range, 68 to 240], P{$<$}0.001), and more patients in the HFOV group than in the control group received neuromuscular blockers (83\% vs. 68\%, P{$<$}0.001). In addition, more patients in the HFOV group received vasoactive drugs (91\% vs. 84\%, P\,=\,0.01) and received them for a longer period than did patients in the control group (5 days vs. 3 days, P\,=\,0.01). Conclusions In adults with moderate-to-severe ARDS, early application of HFOV, as compared with a ventilation strategy of low tidal volume and high positive end-expiratory pressure, does not reduce, and may increase, in-hospital mortality.

Although many of these patients will require ICU admission, little is known regarding their outcomes and the costs incurred. We evaluated this population in order to identify outcomes and cost patterns. Design: Retrospective cohort analysis of a health administrative database. Setting: Two ICUs within a single hospital system. Patients: Eight-thousand four-hundred forty-seven patients admitted to ICU from 2011 to 2014, of whom 332 had a diagnosis of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage. Control patients were defined as randomly selected age, sex, and comorbidity index\textendash matched nonintracranial hemorrhage ICU patients (1:4 matching ratio). Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Mean age of ICU intracranial hemorrhage patients was 60.1 years, and 120 (36.1\&percnt;) died prior to discharge. Intracranial hemorrhage was associated with a mean total cost of \&dollar;75,869, compared with \&dollar;52,471 in control patients (p {$<$} 0.01). Mean cost per survivor of intracranial hemorrhage patients was \&dollar;118,813. Subarachnoid hemorrhage was associated with significantly higher mean total costs than intracerebral hemorrhage (\&dollar;92,794 vs \&dollar;53,491; p {$<$} 0.01) and higher mean cost per day (\&dollar;4,377 vs \&dollar;3,604; p {$<$} 0.01). Patients with intracranial hemorrhage who survived to hospital discharge were significantly costlier than decedents (\&dollar;100,979 vs \&dollar;30,872; p {$<$} 0.01). Intracranial hemorrhage associated with oral anticoagulant use had a mean total cost of \&dollar;152,373, compared with \&dollar;66,548 in nonoral anticoagulant intracranial hemorrhage (p {$<$} 0.01). Conclusions: Patients admitted to ICU with intracranial hemorrhage have high costs and high mortality, leading to elevated cost per survivor. Subarachnoid hemorrhage patients incur greater costs than intracerebral hemorrhage patients, and oral anticoagulant\textendash associated intracerebral hemorrhage is particularly costly.

Accuracy for a predicted good outcome was 63\% (95\% CI, 50\%\textendash 74\%) and for poor outcome 94\% (95\% CI, 85\%\textendash 98\%). Excluding patients who had life support withdrawn, accuracy for good outcome was 73\% (95\% CI, 60\%\textendash{} 84\%) and for poor outcome 87\% (95\% CI, 74\%\textendash 94\%). Accuracy for exact agreement between neurointensivists' mRS predictions and actual 6-month mRS was only 43\% (95\% CI, 35\%\textendash 52\%). Predicted accuracy for QOL was 58\% (95\% CI, 39\%\textendash 74\%) for good/excellent and 67\% (95\% CI, 46\%\textendash{} 83\%) for poor/fair. Of 27 patients for whom withdrawal of care was recommended, 1 patient survived in a vegetative state. Conclusions: Prediction of long-term functional outcomes in critically ill neurologic patients is challenging. Our neurointensivists were more accurate in predicting poor outcome than good outcome in patients requiring mechanical ventilation Ն72 hours.

  abstract = {Our aim was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of transferring patients with intracerebral hemorrhage from centers without specialized neurological intensive care units (neuro-ICUs) to centers with neuro-ICUs. Decision analytic models were developed for the lifetime horizons. Model inputs were derived from the best available data, informed by a variety of previous cost-effectiveness models of stroke. The effect of neuro-ICU care on functional outcomes was modeled in 3 scenarios. A favorable outcomes scenario was modeled based on the best observational data and compared with moderately favorable and least-favorable outcomes scenarios. Health benefits were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs were estimated from a societal perspective. Costs were combined with QALYs gained to generate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. One-way sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to test robustness of the model assumptions. Transferring patients to centers with neuro-ICUs yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the lifetime horizon of \$47 431 per QALY, \$91 674 per QALY, and \$380 358 per QALY for favorable, moderately favorable, and least-favorable scenarios, respectively. Models were robust at a willingness-to-pay threshold of \$100 000 per QALY, with 95.5\%, 75.0\%, and 2.1\% of simulations below the threshold for favorable, moderately favorable, and least-favorable scenarios, respectively. Transferring patients with intracerebral hemorrhage to centers with specialized neuro-ICUs is cost-effective if observational estimates of the neuro-ICU\textendash based functional outcome distribution are accurate. If future work confirms these functional outcome distributions, then a strong societal rationale exists to build systems of care designed to transfer intracerebral hemorrhage patients to specialized neuro-ICUs.}

  abstract = {Object.               Whether decompressive hemicraniectomy is an appropriate treatment for space-occupying middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction is still a controversial issue. Previous studies are in agreement on a reduction of the mortality rate, but the reported functional outcome was highly variable. The authors sought to determine functional impairment, disability, and health-related quality of life (QOL) outcome in long-term survivors who had undergone this procedure, and tried to identify factors related to functional outcome.                                         Methods.               The study included 36 consecutive patients (mean age 58.8 {$\pm$} 12.7 years, 20 men and 16 women) who underwent decompressive hemicraniectomy for treatment of malignant MCA infarction (29 on the right and seven on the left side; mean time to surgery 37.8 {$\pm$} 20 hours). The survival rate was determined at 6 months: 13.7 {$\pm$} 6.7 months after the stroke, a cross-sectional personal investigation of survivors was performed to assess functional impairment, disability, and health-related QOL.                          Survival rates were 78\% at 6 months and 64\% at the time of the follow-up investigation; one patient was lost to follow up. Sixteen of 22 long-term survivors lived at home. The median Barthel Index (BI) was 45 (25th and 75th percentile 19 and 71) and the BI correlated negatively with patient age (r = -0.58, p = 0.005). Three patients reached a BI of at least 90. Older age, more severe neurological deficit on admission, and longer duration of intensive care treatment and mechanical ventilation were significantly associated with worse disability (BI {$<$} 50). The health-related QOL was considerably impaired in the subscales of mobility, household management, and body care.                            Conclusions.               Decompressive hemicraniectomy improves survival in patients with malignant MCA infarction when compared with earlier reports of conservative treatment alone. Functional outcome and QOL remain markedly impaired, especially among elderly patients and in those with a severe neurological deficit at admission.},

Predict-ing which stroke patients will develop malignant edema is imprecise based on clinical data alone. Head computed tomography (CT) imaging is often performed at baseline and 24-h. We determined the incremental value of incorpo-rating imaging-derived features from serial CTs to enhance prediction of malignant edema. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We identified hemispheric stroke patients at three sites with NIHSS\,{$\geq$}\,7 who had baseline as well as 24-h clinical and CT imaging data. We extracted quantitative imaging features from baseline and follow-up CTs, including CSF volume, intracranial reserve (CSF/cranial volume), as well as midline shift (MLS) and infarct-related hypodensity volume. Potentially lethal malignant edema was defined as requiring DHC or dying with MLS over 5-mm. We built machine-learning models using logistic regression first with baseline data and then adding 24-h data including reduction in CSF volume ({$\Delta$}CSF). Model performance was evaluated with cross-validation using metrics of recall (sen-sitivity), precision (predictive value), as well as area under receiver-operating-characteristic and precision-recall curves (AUROC, AUPRC). Results:\hspace{0.6em} Twenty of 361 patients (6\%) died or underwent DHC. Baseline clinical variables alone had recall of 60\% with low precision (7\%), AUROC 0.59, AUPRC 0.15. Adding baseline intracranial reserve improved recall to 80\% and AUROC to 0.82 but precision remained only 16\% (AUPRC 0.28). Incorporating {$\Delta$}CSF improved AUPRC to 0.53 (AUROC 0.91) while all imaging features further improved prediction (recall 90\%, precision 38\%, AUROC 0.96, AUPRC 0.66). Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} Incorporating quantitative CT-based imaging features from baseline and 24-h CT enhances identifica-tion of patients with malignant edema needing DHC. Further refinements and external validation of such imagingbased machine-learning models are required.},

  abstract = {Background: How to select variables and identify functional forms for continuous variables is a key concern when creating a multivariable model. Ad hoc `traditional' approaches to variable selection have been in use for at least 50 years. Similarly, methods for determining functional forms for continuous variables were first suggested many years ago. More recently, many alternative approaches to address these two challenges have been proposed, but knowledge of their properties and meaningful comparisons between them are scarce. To define a state of the art and to provide evidence-supported guidance to researchers who have only a basic level of statistical knowledge, many outstanding issues in multivariable modelling remain. Our main aims are to identify and illustrate such gaps in the literature and present them at a moderate technical level to the wide community of practitioners, researchers and students of statistics. Methods: We briefly discuss general issues in building descriptive regression models, strategies for variable selection, different ways of choosing functional forms for continuous variables and methods for combining the selection of variables and functions. We discuss two examples, taken from the medical literature, to illustrate problems in the practice of modelling. Results: Our overview revealed that there is not yet enough evidence on which to base recommendations for the selection of variables and functional forms in multivariable analysis. Such evidence may come from comparisons between alternative methods. In particular, we highlight seven important topics that require further investigation and make suggestions for the direction of further research. Conclusions: Selection of variables and of functional forms are important topics in multivariable analysis. To define a state of the art and to provide evidence-supported guidance to researchers who have only a basic level of statistical knowledge, further comparative research is required.},

  abstract = {Background: Intracranial hypertension (ICH) is a major cause of death after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Continuous hyperosmolar therapy (CHT) has been proposed for the treatment of ICH, but its effectiveness is controversial. We compared the mortality and outcomes in patients with TBI with ICH treated or not with CHT. Methods: We included patients with TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale {$\leq$} 12 and trauma-associated lesion on brain computed tomography (CT) scan) from the databases of the prospective multicentre trials Corti-TC, BI-VILI and ATLANREA. CHT consisted of an intravenous infusion of NaCl 20\% for 24 hours or more. The primary outcome was the risk of survival at day 90, adjusted for predefined covariates and baseline differences, allowing us to reduce the bias resulting from confounding factors in observational studies. A systematic review was conducted including studies published from 1966 to December 2016. Results: Among the 1086 included patients, 545 (51.7\%) developed ICH (143 treated and 402 not treated with CHT). In patients with ICH, the relative risk of survival at day 90 with CHT was 1.43 (95\% CI, 0.99\textendash 2.06, p = 0.05). The adjusted hazard ratio for survival was 1.74 (95\% CI, 1.36\textendash 2.23, p {$<$} 0.001) in propensity-score-adjusted analysis. At day 90, favourable outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale 4\textendash 5) occurred in 45.2\% of treated patients with ICH and in 35.8\% of patients with ICH not treated with CHT (p = 0.06). A review of the literature including 1304 patients from eight studies suggests that CHT is associated with a reduction of in-ICU mortality (intervention, 112/474 deaths (23.6\%) vs. control, 244/781 deaths (31.2\%); OR 1.42 (95\% CI, 1.04\textendash 1.95), p = 0.03, I2 = 15\%). Conclusions: CHT for the treatment of posttraumatic ICH was associated with improved adjusted 90-day survival. This result was strengthened by a review of the literature.},

We developed a health system Critical Care Program based at an academic medical center. The main feature of our program is an intensivist who shares on-site and telemedicine clinical responsibilities. Tele-ICU facilitates the standardization of high-quality critical care across the system. A common electronic medical record made the communications among the ICUs feasible. Combining faculty from medical and surgical critical care divisions increased the productivity of intensivists.Study DesignWe retrospectively reviewed the administrative database data from 2011 and 2012, including mean census, number of transfers, age, sex, case mix index, mortality, readmissions, and financial data.ResultsThe Critical Care program has 106 adult ICU beds; 54 of those beds can be managed remotely using tele-ICU based at the main University hospital. The mean midnight census of the system for 2012 was 69.44 and total patient-days were 34,406. The capital cost of the tele-ICU was \$1,186,220. The annual operational cost is \$1,250,112 or \$23,150 per monitored ICU-bed. Unadjusted mortality was 6.5\% before and 4.9\% after implementation (p {$<$} 0.0002).ConclusionsWe describe a novel health system level ICU program built using ``off the shelf'' technology based on a large University medical center and a tele-ICU with a full degree of treatment authority across the system.},

  abstract = {For patients who survive the initial bleeding event of a ruptured brain aneurysm, delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is one of the most important causes of mortality and poor neurological outcome. New insights in the last decade have led to an important paradigm shift in the understanding of DCI pathogenesis. Large-vessel cerebral vasospasm has been challenged as the sole causal mechanism; new hypotheses now focus on the early brain injury, microcirculatory dysfunction, impaired autoregulation, and spreading depolarization. Prevention of DCI primarily relies on nimodipine administration and optimization of blood volume and cardiac performance. Neurological monitoring is essential for early DCI detection and intervention. Serial clinical examination combined with intermittent transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and CT angiography (with or without perfusion) is the most commonly used monitoring paradigm, and usually suffices in good grade patients. By contrast, poor grade patients (WFNS grades 4 and 5) require more advanced monitoring because stupor and coma reduce sensitivity to the effects of ischemia. Greater reliance on CT perfusion imaging, continuous electroencephalography, and invasive brain multimodality monitoring are potential strategies to improve situational awareness as it relates to detecting DCI. Pharmacologically-induced hypertension combined with volume is the established first-line therapy for DCI; a good clinical response with reversal of the presenting deficit occurs in 70 \% of patients. Medically refractory DCI, defined as failure to respond adequately to these measures, should trigger step-wise escalation of rescue therapy. Level 1 rescue therapy consists of cardiac output optimization, hemoglobin optimization, and endovascular intervention, including angioplasty and intra-arterial vasodilator infusion. In highly refractory cases, level 2 rescue therapies are also considered, none of which have been validated. This review provides an overview of current state-of-the-art care for DCI management.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The postoperative management of patients who undergo brain tumor resection frequently occurs in an ICU. However, the routine admission of all patients to an ICU following surgery is controversial. This study seeks to identify the frequency with which patients undergoing elective supratentorial tumor resection require care, aside from frequent neurologic checks, that is specific to an ICU and to determine the frequency of new complications during ICU admission. Additionally, clinical predictors of ICU-specific care are identified, and a scoring system to discriminate patients most likely to require ICU-specific treatment is validated. Design: Retrospective observational cohort study. Setting: Academic neurosurgical center. Patients: Two-hundred consecutive adult patients who underwent supratentorial brain tumor surgery. An additional 100 consecutive patients were used to validate the prediction score. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Univariate statistics and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify clinical characteristics associated with ICU-specific treatment. Eighteen patients (9\&percnt;) received ICU-specific care, and 19 (9.5\&percnt;) experienced new complications or underwent emergent imaging while in the ICU. Factors significantly associated with ICU-specific care included nonelective admission, preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale, and volume of IV fluids. A simple clinical scoring system that included Karnofsky Performance Status less than 70 (1 point), general endotracheal anesthesia (1 point), and any early postoperative complications (2 points) demonstrated excellent ability to discriminate patients who required ICU-specific care in both the derivation and validation cohorts. Conclusions: Less than 10\&percnt; of patients required ICU-specific care following supratentorial tumor resection. A simple clinical scoring system may aid clinicians in stratifying the risk of requiring ICU care and could inform triage decisions when ICU bed availability is limited.},

Methods:               We performed a systematic search resulting in 10 studies reporting stroke frequency among COVID-19 patients, which were pooled with one unpublished series from Canada. We applied random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the proportion of stroke among COVID-19. We performed an additional systematic search for cases series of stroke in COVID-19 patients (n=125) and we pooled these data with 35 unpublished cases from Canada, USA, and Iran. We analyzed clinical characteristics and in-hospital mortality stratified into age groups ({$<$}50, 50-70, {$>$}70 years). We applied cluster analyses to identify specific clinical phenotypes and their relationship with death.                                         Results:               The proportion of COVID-19 patients with stroke (1.8\%, 95\%CI 0.9-3.7\%) and in-hospital mortality (34.4\%, 95\%CI 27.2-42.4\%) were exceedingly high. Mortality was 67\% lower in patients {$<$}50 years-old relative to those {$>$}70 years-old (OR 0.33, 95\%CI 0.12-0.94, P=0.039). Large vessel occlusion was twice as frequent (46.9\%) as previously reported and was high across all age groups, even in the absence of risk factors or comorbidities. A clinical phenotype characterized by older age, a higher burden of comorbidities, and severe COVID-19 respiratory symptoms, was associated with the highest in-hospital mortality (58.6\%) and a 3x higher risk of death than the rest of the cohort (OR 3.52, 95\%CI 1.53-8.09, P=0.003).                                         Conclusions:               Stroke is relatively frequent among COVID-19 patients and has devastating consequences across all ages. The interplay of older age, comorbidities, and severity of COVID-19 respiratory symptoms is associated with an extremely elevated mortality.},

  abstract = {Background The questions patients are asked about their preferences with regard to life-sustaining treatment usually focus on specific interventions, but the outcomes of treatment and their likelihood affect patients' preferences. Methods We administered a questionnaire about treatment preferences to 226 persons who were 60 years of age or older and who had a limited life expectancy due to cancer, congestive heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study participants were asked whether they would want to receive a given treatment, first when the outcome was known with certainty and then with different likelihoods of an adverse outcome. The outcome without treatment was specified as death from the underlying disease. Results The burden of treatment (i.e., the length of the hospital stay, extent of testing, and invasiveness of interventions), the outcome, and the likelihood of the outcome all influenced treatment preferences. For a low-burden treatment with the restoration of current health, 98.7 percent of participants said they would choose to receive the treatment (rather than not receive it and die), but 11.2 percent of these participants would not choose the treatment if it had a high burden. If the outcome was survival but with severe functional impairment or cognitive impairment, 74.4 percent and 88.8 percent of these participants, respectively, would not choose treatment. The number of participants who said they would choose treatment declined as the likelihood of an adverse outcome increased, with fewer participants choosing treatment when the possible outcome was functional or cognitive impairment than when it was death. Preferences did not differ according to the primary diagnosis. Conclusions Advance care planning should take into account patients' attitudes toward the burden of treatment, the possible outcomes, and their likelihood. The likelihood of adverse functional and cognitive outcomes of treatment requires explicit consideration. (N Engl J Med 2002;346:1061-6.)},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash Induced hypertension is widely used to treat delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, but a literature review shows that its presumed effectiveness is based on uncontrolled caseseries only. We here report clinical outcome of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients with DCI included in a randomized trial on the effectiveness of induced hypertension. Methods\textemdash Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients with clinical symptoms of DCI were randomized to induced hypertension or no induced hypertension. Risk ratios for poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score {$>$}3) at 3 months, with 95\% confidence intervals, were calculated and adjusted for age, clinical condition at admission and at time of DCI, and amount of blood on initial computed tomographic scan with Poisson regression analysis. Results\textemdash The trial aiming to include 240 patients was ended, based on lack of effect on cerebral perfusion and slow recruitment, when 21 patients had been randomized to induced hypertension, and 20 patients to no hypertension. With induced hypertension, the adjusted risk ratio for poor outcome was 1.0 (95\% confidence interval, 0.6\textendash 1.8) and the risk ratio for serious adverse events 2.1 (95\% confidence interval, 0.9\textendash 5.0). Conclusions\textemdash Before this trial, the effectiveness of induced hypertension for DCI in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients was unknown because current literature consists only of uncontrolled case series. The results from our premature halted trial do not add any evidence to support induced hypertension and show that this treatment can lead to serious adverse events.},

Bayesian inference is a natural way to propagate these uncertainties, with hierarchical modeling capturing variation in these parameters across experiments. Another concern is the people in the sample not being representative of the general population. Statistical adjustment cannot without strong assumptions correct for selection bias in an opt-in sample, but multilevel regression and poststratification can at least adjust for known differences between the sample and the population. We demonstrate these models with code in Stan and discuss their application to a controversial recent study of COVID-19 antibodies in a sample of people from the Stanford University area. Wide posterior intervals make it impossible to evaluate the quantitative claims of that study regarding the number of unreported infections. For future studies, the methods described here should facilitate more accurate estimates of disease prevalence from imperfect tests performed on non-representative samples.},

However, these ``knowns'' about how to make a good presidential election forecast come with many unknowns due to the challenges of evaluating forecast calibration and communication. We highlight how incentives may shape forecasts, and particularly forecast uncertainty, in light of calibration challenges. We illustrate these challenges in creating, communicating, and evaluating election predictions, using the Economist and Fivethirtyeight forecasts of the 2020 election as examples, and o er recommendations for forecasters and scholars.},

  abstract = {Decisions in statistical data analysis are often justified, criticized or avoided by using concepts of objectivity and subjectivity. We argue that the words `objective' and `subjective' in statistics discourse are used in a mostly unhelpful way, and we propose to replace each of them with broader collections of attributes, with objectivity replaced by transparency , consensus, impartiality and correspondence to observable reality , and subjectivity replaced by awareness of multiple perspectives and context dependence. Together with stability , these make up a collection of virtues that we think is helpful in discussions of statistical foundations and practice. The advantage of these reformulations is that the replacement terms do not oppose each other and that they give more specific guidance about what statistical science strives to achieve. Instead of debating over whether a given statistical method is subjective or objective (or normatively debating the relative merits of subjectivity and objectivity in statistical practice), we can recognize desirable attributes such as transparency and acknowledgement of multiple perspectives as complementary goals. We demonstrate the implications of our proposal with recent applied examples from pharmacology, election polling and socio-economic stratification. The aim of the paper is to push users and developers of statistical methods towards more effective use of diverse sources of information and more open acknowledgement of assumptions and goals.},

We challenge the Type I error paradigm that underlies these corrections. Moreover we posit that the problem of multiple comparisons can disappear entirely when viewed from a hierarchical Bayesian perspective. We propose building multilevel models in the settings where multiple comparisons arise. Multilevel models perform partial pooling (shifting estimates toward each other), whereas classical procedures typically keep the centers of intervals stationary, adjusting for multiple comparisons by making the intervals wider (or, equivalently, adjusting the p values corresponding to intervals of fixed width). Thus, multilevel models address the multiple comparisons problem and also yield more efficient estimates, especially in settings with low group-level variation, which is where multiple comparisons are a particular concern.},

  abstract = {Background: Dosing of four factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4PCC) for warfarin reversal remains controversial. Recently, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) recommended a low-dose PCC regimen as an option for warfarin reversal in acute major bleeding. We performed a retrospective study evaluating if a modified version of the ACC guideline recommendations was effective for warfarin reversal in acute major bleeds when compared to traditional variable dosing. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who received 4PCC for warfarin reversal in a 12 month period. We included patients that were {$\geq$}18 years of age, received 4PCC for warfarin reversal, and had an initial International Normalized Ratio (INR) of N2. Our primary outcome was the number of patients who had a post4PCC infusion INR of b1.6. Results: A total of 60 patients were included in the final analysis with 30 patients stratified to the traditional dosing and low-dose groups, respectively. Patient demographics were similar between both groups. We found no difference in the number of patients who had a post-4PCC infusion INR b1.6 between the traditional dosing and low dosing group (90.0\% vs. 86.7\%; p = 0.68). Additionally, we found no difference between post-infusion median INRs in each group (1.35 vs. 1.30; p = 0.16). Approximately 1000 units per patient were spared when utilizing the low-dose regimen. Conclusion: A modified version of the ACC's low-dose 4PCC option for warfarin reversal achieves similar outcomes for lowering INR values compared to traditional variable dosing regimens. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {The potential for guarantee-time bias (GTB), also known as immortal time bias, exists whenever an analysis that is timed from enrollment or random assignment, such as disease-free or overall survival, is compared across groups defined by a classifying event occurring sometime during follow-up. The types of events associated with GTB are varied and may include the occurrence of objective disease response, onset of toxicity, or seroconversion. However, comparative analyses using these types of events as predictors are different from analyses using baseline characteristics that are specified completely before the occurrence of any outcome event. Recognizing the potential for GTB is not always straightforward, and it can be challenging to know when GTB is influencing the results of an analysis. This article defines GTB, provides examples of GTB from several published articles, and discusses three analytic techniques that can be used to remove the bias: conditional landmark analysis, extended Cox model, and inverse probability weighting. The strengths and limitations of each technique are presented. As an example, we explore the effect of bisphosphonate use on disease-free survival (DFS) using data from the BIG (Breast International Group) 1-98 randomized clinical trial. An analysis using a naive approach showed substantial benefit for patients who received bisphosphonate therapy. In contrast, analyses using the three methods known to remove GTB showed no statistical evidence of a reduction in risk of a DFS event with bisphosphonate therapy.},

When patients with the same syndrome diagnosis do not share the pathways that lead to death (the attributable risk), any therapy can only lead to small effects in these populations. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show how the syndromeattributable risks of critical illness-associated diagnoses are likely overestimated using common statistical methods. This overestimation of syndrome-attributable risks leads to a corresponding overestimation of attainable treatment effects and an underestimation of required sample sizes. We demonstrate that larger and more `pragmatic' randomized trials are not the solution because they decrease therapeutic and diagnostic precision, the therapeutic effect size and the probability of finding a beneficial effect. Finally, we argue that the most logical solution is a renewed focus on mechanistic research into the complexities of critical illness syndromes.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In parallel investigator-initiated, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials in Canada (``Spot Sign'' Selection of Intracerebral Hemorrhage to Guide Hemostatic Therapy [SPOTLIGHT]) and the United States (The Spot Sign for Predicting and Treating ICH Growth Study [STOP-IT]) with harmonized protocols and a preplanned individual patient\textendash level pooled analysis, patients presenting to the emergency department with an acute primary spontaneous ICH and a spot sign on CT angiography were recruited. Data were collected from November 2010 to May 2016. Data were analyzed from November 2016 to May 2017. INTERVENTIONS Eligible patients were randomly assigned 80 {$\mu$}g/kg of intravenous rFVIIa or placebo as soon as possible within 6.5 hours of stroke onset. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Head CT at 24 hours assessed parenchymal ICH volume expansion from baseline (primary outcome) and total (ie, parenchymal plus intraventricular) hemorrhage volume expansion (secondary outcome). The pooled analysis compared hemorrhage expansion between groups by analyzing 24-hour volumes in a linear regression model adjusted for baseline volumes, time from stroke onset to treatment, and trial. RESULTS Of the 69 included patients, 35 (51\%) were male, and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 70 (59-80) years. Baseline median (IQR) ICH volumes were 16.3 (9.6-39.2) mL in the rFVIIa group and 20.4 (8.6-32.6) mL in the placebo group. Median (IQR) time from CT to treatment was 71 (57-96) minutes, and the median (IQR) time from stroke onset to treatment was 178 (138-197) minutes. The median (IQR) increase in ICH volume from baseline to 24 hours was small in both the rFVIIa group (2.5 [0-10.2] mL) and placebo group (2.6 [0-6.6] mL). After adjustment, there was no difference between groups on measures of ICH or total hemorrhage expansion. At 90 days, 9 of 30 patients in the rFVIIa group and 13 of 34 in the placebo group had died or were severely disabled (P = .60). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with spot sign\textendash positive ICH treated a median of about 3 hours from stroke onset, rFVIIa did not significantly improve radiographic or clinical outcomes.},

Probabilistic forecasting aims to maximize the sharpness of the predictive distributions, subject to calibration, on the basis of the available information set. We formalize and study notions of calibration in a prediction space setting. In practice, probabilistic calibration can be checked by examining probability integral transform (PIT) histograms. Proper scoring rules such as the logarithmic score and the continuous ranked probability score serve to assess calibration and sharpness simultaneously. As a special case, consistent scoring functions provide decision-theoretically coherent tools for evaluating point forecasts. We emphasize methodological links to parametric and nonparametric distributional regression techniques, which attempt to model and to estimate conditional distribution functions; we use the context of statistically postprocessed ensemble forecasts in numerical weather prediction as an example. Throughout, we illustrate concepts and methodologies in data examples.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Remdesivir is an RNA polymerase inhibitor with potent antiviral activity in vitro and efficacy in animal models of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). METHODS We conducted a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial involving hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, oxygen saturation of 94\% or less while they were breathing ambient air, and radiologic evidence of pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous remdesivir for either 5 days or 10 days. All patients received 200 mg of remdesivir on day 1 and 100 mg once daily on subsequent days. The primary end point was clinical status on day 14, assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale. RESULTS In total, 397 patients underwent randomization and began treatment (200 patients for 5 days and 197 for 10 days). The median duration of treatment was 5 days (interquartile range, 5 to 5) in the 5-day group and 9 days (interquartile range, 5 to 10) in the 10-day group. At baseline, patients randomly assigned to the 10-day group had significantly worse clinical status than those assigned to the 5-day group (P\,=\,0.02). By day 14, a clinical improvement of 2 points or more on the ordinal scale occurred in 64\% of patients in the 5-day group and in 54\% in the 10-day group. After adjustment for baseline clinical status, patients in the 10-day group had a distribution in clinical status at day 14 that was similar to that among patients in the 5-day group (P\,=\,0.14). The most common adverse events were nausea (9\% of patients), worsening respiratory failure (8\%), elevated alanine aminotransferase level (7\%), and constipation (7\%).

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Families in the neurologic ICU urgently request goals-ofcare decision support and shared decision-making tools. We recently developed a goals-of-care decision aid for surrogates of critically ill traumatic brain injury patients using a systematic development process adherent to the International Patient Decision Aid Standards. To widen its applicability, we adapted this decision aid to critically ill patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and large hemispheric acute ischemic stroke. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Two academic neurologic ICUs. SUBJECTS: Twenty family members of patients in the neurologic ICU were recruited from July 2018 to October 2018. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We reviewed the existing critically ill traumatic brain injury patients decision aid for content and changed: 1) the essential background information, 2) disease-specific terminology to ``hemorrhagic stroke'' and ``ischemic stroke'', and 3) disease-specific prognosis tailored to individual patients. We conducted acceptability and usability testing using validated scales. All three decision aids contain information from validated, disease-specific outcome prediction models, as recommended by international decision aid standards, including careful emphasis on their uncertainty. We replaced the individualizable icon arrays graphically depicting probabilities of a traumatic brain injury patient's prognosis with icon arrays visualizing intracerebral hemorrhage and hemispheric acute ischemic stroke prognostic probabilities using high-quality disease-specific data. We selected the Intracerebral Hemorrhage Score with validated 12-month outcomes, and for hemispheric acute ischemic stroke, the 12-month outcomes from landmark hemicraniectomy trials. Twenty family members participated in acceptability and usability testing (n = 11 for the intracerebral hemorrhage decision aid; n = 9 for the acute ischemic stroke decision aid). Median usage time was 22 minutes (interquartile range, 16\textendash 26 min). Usability was excellent (median System Usability Scale = 84/100 [interquartile range, 61\textendash 93; with {$>$} 68 indicating good usability]); 89\% of participants graded the decision aid content as good or excellent, and greater than or equal to 90\% rated it favorably for information amount, balance, and comprehensibility. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully adapted goals-of-care decision aids for use in surrogates of critically ill patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and hemispheric acute ischemic stroke and found excellent usability and Kelsey J.

  abstract = {Endovascular treatment is a highly effective therapy for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion and has recently revolutionized stroke care. Oftentimes, ischemic core extent on baseline imaging is used to determine endovascular treatment-eligibility. There are, however, 3 fundamental issues with the core concept: First, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, which are mostly used in the acute stroke setting, are not able to precisely determine whether and to what extent brain tissue is infarcted (core) or still viable, due to variability in tissue vulnerability, the phenomenon of selective neuronal loss and lack of a reliable gold standard. Second, treatment decision-making in acute stroke is multifactorial, and as such, the relative importance of single variables, including imaging factors, is reduced. Third, there are often discrepancies between core volume and clinical outcome. This review will address the uncertainty in terminology and proposes a direction towards more clarity. This theoretical exercise needs empirical data that clarify the definitions further and prove its value.},

  abstract = {Two different main concepts for the treatment of severe traumatic brain injury have been established during the last 15 years, namely the more conventional concept recommended in well-established guidelines (eg, the US Guideline, European Guideline, Addelbrook's Guideline from Cambridge) on the one hand, and the Lund concept from the University Hospital of Lund, Sweden on the other. Owing to the lack of well-controlled randomized outcome studies comparing these 2 main therapeutic approaches, we cannot conclude that one is better than the other. This study is the PRO part in a PRO-CON debate on the Lund concept in the present journal. Although the Lund concept is based on a physiology-oriented approach dealing with hemodynamic principles of brain volume and brain perfusion regulation, traditional treatments are primarily based on a meta-analytic approach from clinical studies. High cerebral perfusion pressure has been an essential goal in the conventional treatments (the cerebral perfusion pressure-guided approach), even though it has been modified in a recent update of US guidelines. The Lund concept has instead concentrated on management of brain edema and intracranial pressure, simultaneously with improvement of cerebral perfusion and oxygenation (the intracranial pressure and perfusion-guided approach). Although conventional guidelines are restricted to clinical data from meta-analytic surveys, the physiological approach of the Lund therapy finds support in both experimental and clinical studies. It offers a wider base and can also give recommendations regarding fluid therapy, lung protection, optimal hemoglobin concentration, temperature control, the use of decompressive craniotomy, and ventricular drainage. This study puts forward arguments in support of the Lund therapy.},

  abstract = {Important aspects of sepsis management include early diagnosis as well as timely and specific treatment in the first few hours of triage. However, diagnosis and differentiation from non-infectious causes often cause uncertainties and potential time delays. Correct use of antibiotics still represents a major challenge, leading to increased risk for opportunistic infections, resistances to multiple antimicrobial agents and toxic side effects, which in turn increase mortality and healthcare costs. Optimized procedures for reliable diagnosis and management of antibiotic therapy has great potential to improve patient care. Herein, biomarkers have been shown to improve infection diagnosis, help in early risk stratification and provide prognostic information which helps optimizing therapeutic decisions (``antibiotic stewardship''). In this context, the use of the blood infection marker procalcitonin (PCT) has gained much attention. There is still no gold standard for the detection of sepsis and use of conventional diagnostic approaches are restricted by some limitations. Therefore, additional tests are necessary to enable early and reliable diagnosis. PCT has good discriminatory properties to differentiate between bacterial and viral inflammations with rapidly available results. Further, PCT adds to risk stratification and prognostication, which may influence appropriate use of health-care resources and therapeutic options. PCT kinetics over time also improves the monitoring of critically ill patients with sepsis and thus influences decisions regarding de-escalation of antibiotics. Most importantly, PCT helps in guiding antibiotic use in patients with respiratory infection and sepsis by limiting initiation and by shortening treatment duration. To date, PCT is the best studied biomarker regarding antibiotic stewardship. Still, further research is needed to understand optimal use of PCT, also in combination with other remerging diagnostic tests for most efficient sepsis care.},

Data Sources:~         PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and CENTRAL from inception to September 15, 2018.         Study Selection:~         Adult studies validating the Intracerebral Hemorrhage score for mortality prediction in nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage at 1 month/discharge or sooner.         Data Extraction:~         Data were collected on the following aspects of study design: population studied, level of care, timing of outcome measurement, mean study year, and mean cohort Intracerebral Hemorrhage score. The summary measures of interest were discrimination as assessed by the C-statistic and calibration as assessed by the standardized mortality ratio (observed:expected mortality ratio). Random effect models were used to pool both measures. Heterogeneity was measured using the I2 statistic and explored using subgroup analysis and meta-regression.         Data Synthesis:~         Fifty-five studies provided data on discrimination, and 35 studies provided data on calibration. Overall, the Intracerebral Hemorrhage score discriminated well (pooled C-statistic 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.82\textendash 0.85) but overestimated mortality (pooled observed:expected mortality ratio = 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.78\textendash 0.97), with high heterogeneity for both estimates (I2 80\% and 84\%, respectively). Discrimination was affected by study mean Intracerebral Hemorrhage score ({$\beta$} = \textendash 0.05), and calibration was affected by disease severity, with the score overestimating mortality for patients with an Intracerebral Hemorrhage score greater than 3 (observed:expected mortality ratio = 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.78\textendash 0.91). Mortality rates were reproducible across cohorts for patients with an Intracerebral Hemorrhage score 0\textendash 1 (I2 = 15\%).         Conclusions:~         The Intracerebral Hemorrhage score is a valid clinical prediction rule for short-term mortality in intracerebral hemorrhage patients but discriminated mortality worse in more severe cohorts. It also overestimated mortality in the highest Intracerebral Hemorrhage score patients, with significant inconsistency between cohorts. These results suggest that mortality for these patients is dependent on factors not included in the score. Further studies are needed to determine these factors.},

METHODS In this randomized trial, we compared rivaroxaban (20 mg once daily) with doseadjusted warfarin (target international normalized ratio, 2.0 to 3.0) in patients with atrial fibrillation and a bioprosthetic mitral valve. The primary outcome was a composite of death, major cardiovascular events (stroke, transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, valve thrombosis, or hospitalization for heart failure), or major bleeding at 12 months.

RESULTS A total of 1005 patients were enrolled at 49 sites in Brazil. A primary-outcome event occurred at a mean of 347.5 days in the rivaroxaban group and 340.1 days in the warfarin group (difference calculated as restricted mean survival time, 7.4 days; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -1.4 to 16.3; P{$<$}0.001 for noninferiority). Death from cardiovascular causes or thromboembolic events occurred in 17 patients (3.4\%) in the rivaroxaban group and in 26 (5.1\%) in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.35 to 1.20). The incidence of stroke was 0.6\% in the rivaroxaban group and 2.4\% in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95\% CI, 0.07 to 0.88). Major bleeding occurred in 7 patients (1.4\%) in the rivaroxaban group and in 13 (2.6\%) in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95\% CI, 0.21 to 1.35). The frequency of other serious adverse events was similar in the two groups. This article was published on November 14, 2020, at NEJM.org.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To test whether tocilizumab decreases mortality in this population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The data for this study were derived from a multicenter cohort study of 4485 adults with COVID-19 admitted to participating intensive care units (ICUs) at 68 hospitals across the US from March 4 to May 10, 2020. Critically ill adults with COVID-19 were categorized according to whether they received or did not receive tocilizumab in the first 2 days of admission to the ICU. Data were collected retrospectively until June 12, 2020. A Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting was used to adjust for confounding. EXPOSURES Treatment with tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Time to death, compared via hazard ratios (HRs), and 30-day mortality, compared via risk differences. RESULTS Among the 3924 patients included in the analysis (2464 male [62.8\%]; median age, 62 [interquartile range \{IQR\}, 52-71] years), 433 (11.0\%) received tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission. Patients treated with tocilizumab were younger (median age, 58 [IQR, 48-65] vs 63 [IQR, 52-72] years) and had a higher prevalence of hypoxemia on ICU admission (205 of 433 [47.3\%] vs 1322 of 3491 [37.9\%] with mechanical ventilation and a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen of {$<$}200 mm Hg) than patients not treated with tocilizumab. After applying inverse probability weighting, baseline and severity-of-illness characteristics were well balanced between groups. A total of 1544 patients (39.3\%) died, including 125 (28.9\%) treated with tocilizumab and 1419 (40.6\%) not treated with tocilizumab. In the primary analysis, during a median follow-up of 27 (IQR, 14-37) days, patients treated with tocilizumab had a lower risk of death compared with those not treated with tocilizumab (HR, 0.71; 95\% CI, 0.56-0.92). The estimated 30-day mortality was 27.5\% (95\% CI, 21.2\%-33.8\%) in the tocilizumab-treated patients and 37.1\% (95\% CI, 35.5\%-38.7\%) in the non-tocilizumab\textendash treated patients (risk difference, 9.6\%; 95\% CI, 3.1\%-16.0\%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this cohort study, the risk of in-hospital mortality in this study was lower in patients treated with tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission compared with patients whose treatment did not include early use of tocilizumab. However, the findings may be susceptible to unmeasured confounding, and further research from randomized clinical trials is needed.},

RESULTS: We identified 790 patients with BAVM (51\% female; 63\% white; mean age+/-SD at diagnosis: 38+/-19 years) between 1961 and 2001. Patients who presented with ICH experienced a higher rate of subsequent ICH than those who presented without ICH under multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 3.6; 95\% CI, 1.1 to 11.9; P{$<$}0.032). The effect was similar across race-ethnicity and gender. This difference in ICH rates was greatest in the first year (7\% versus 3\% per year) and converged over time. The effect of subsequent ICH on functional status was similar to that of the initial ICH. CONCLUSIONS: Presentation with ICH was the most important predictor of future ICH, confirming previous studies. Future ICH had similar impact on functional outcome as incident ICH. Intervention to prevent ICH would be of potentially greater benefit to patients presenting with ICH, although the advantage decreases over time.},

  abstract = {Background/Objective:\hspace{0.6em} Demonstrating a benefit of acute treatment to patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) requires identifying which patients have a potentially modifiable outcome, where treatment could favorably shift a patient's expected outcome. A decision rule for which patients have a modifiable outcome could improve the targeting of treatments. We sought to determine which patients with ICH have a modifiable outcome. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} Patients with ICH were prospectively identified at two institutions. Data on hematoma volumes, medication histories, and other variables of interest were collected. ICH outcomes were evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), assessed at 14 days and 3 months after ICH, with ``good outcome'' defined as 0\textendash 3 (independence or better) and ``poor outcome'' defined as 4\textendash 6 (dependence or worse). Supervised machine learning models identified the best predictors of good versus poor outcomes at Institution 1. Models were validated using repeated fivefold crossvalidation as well as testing on the entirely independent sample at Institution 2. Model fit was assessed with area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results:\hspace{0.6em} Model performance at Institution 1 was strong for both 14-day (AUC of 0.79 [0.77, 0.81] for decision tree, 0.85 [0.84, 0.87] for random forest) and 3 month (AUC of 0.75 [0.73, 0.77] for decision tree, 0.82 [0.80, 0.84] for random forest) outcomes. Independent predictors of functional outcome selected by the algorithms as important included hematoma volume at hospital admission, hematoma expansion, intraventricular hemorrhage, overall ICH Score, and Glasgow Coma Scale. Hematoma expansion was the only potentially modifiable independent predictor of outcome and was compatible with ``good'' or ``poor'' outcome in a subset of patients with low hematoma volumes, good Glasgow Coma scale and premorbid modified Rankin Scale scores. Models trained on harmonized data also predicted patient outcomes well at Institution 2 using decision tree (AUC 0.69 [0.63, 0.75]) and random forests (AUC 0.78 [0.72, 0.84]). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Patient outcomes are predictable to a high level in patients with ICH, and hematoma expansion is the sole-modifiable predictor of these outcomes across two outcome types and modeling approaches. According to decision tree analyses predicting outcome at 3 months, patients with a high Glasgow Coma Scale score, less than 44.5 mL hematoma volume at admission, and relatively low premorbid modified Rankin Score in particular have a modifiable outcome and appear to be candidates for future interventions to improve outcomes after ICH.},

Radiologic imaging techniques are being developed for accurate detection and early diagnosis of disease, which will eventually affect patient outcomes. Hence, results obtained by radiological means, especially diagnostic imaging, are frequently incorporated into a clinical prediction model as important predictive parameters, and the performance of the prediction model may improve in both diagnostic and prognostic settings. This article explains in a conceptual manner the overall process of developing and validating a clinical prediction model involving radiological parameters in relation to the study design and statistical methods. Collection of a raw dataset; selection of an appropriate statistical model; predictor selection; evaluation of model performance using a calibration plot, Hosmer-Lemeshow test and c-index; internal and external validation; comparison of different models using c-index, net reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination improvement; and a method to create an easy-to-use prediction score system will be addressed. This article may serve as a practical methodological reference for clinical researchers.}

  abstract = {Many studies have focused on short term mortality after primary intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) whereas long term prognosis and causes of death have been less studied. We therefore examined these issues in a population based cohort of 1 year ICH survivors. ICH patients in a defined Swedish population (1.14 million inhabitants) were prospectively registered during 1996. Patients surviving 1 year after ICH onset were followed-up regarding survival status and cause of death until December 2009 using data from the National Census Office and the National Cause of Death Register. Patient prognosis was also compared with the general population using official Swedish mortality data. Clinical and radiological prognostic factors were evaluated. Of 323 patients with ICH, 172 (53\%) survived after 1 year, 127 (39\%) after 5 years and 57 (18\%) after 13 years. Mortality of the 172, 1 year survivors (mean age 67.7 years at ICH) persistently exceeded expected mortality; 13 years post ictus survival was only 34\% compared with 61\% in the general population. Of 115 deaths among the 172, 1 year survivors, 36\% were from cerebrovascular disease and 19\% from ischaemic heart disease. Independent risk factors for death among 1 year survivors were age (HR 1.08 per year; 95\% CI 1.06 to 1.10; p{$<$}0.001), diabetes mellitus at baseline (HR 2.10; 95\% CI 1.18 to 3.74; p=0.012) and anticoagulant therapy (HR 1.99; 95\% CI 1.12 to 3.53; p=0.018) at ICH onset. One year survivors after ICH had a substantial and persisting excess mortality compared with the general population. Major causes of death were stroke and ischaemic heart disease.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To refine our understanding of normal ICP values and determine the ICP threshold most strongly associated with outcome. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective observational study (2004-2010), with outcomes determined at hospital discharge. The study included neurocritical care patients from a single level I trauma center, San Francisco General Hospital. Three hundred eighty-three patients had a traumatic brain injury with or without craniectomy; 140 patients had another indication for ICP monitoring. Consecutive patients were studied. Data analyses were completed between March 2015 and December 2019. EXPOSURES Five hundred twenty-three ICP-monitored patients. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A computer system prospectively and automatically collected 1-minute physiologic data from patients in the intensive care unit during a 6-year period. Mean ICP was calculated, as was the proportion of ICP values greater than thresholds from 1 to 80 mm Hg in 1\textendash mm Hg increments. The association between these measures and outcome was explored for various epochs up to 30 days from the time of injury. A principal component analysis was used to explore physiologic changes at various ICP thresholds, and elastic net regression was used to identify ICP thresholds most strongly associated with Glasgow Outcome Scale score at discharge. RESULTS Of the 523 studied patients, 70.7\% of studied patients were men (n = 370) and 72.1\% had a traumatic brain injury (n = 377). A total of 4 090 964 1-minute ICP measurements were recorded for the included patients (7.78 years of recordings). Intracranial pressure values of 8 to 9 mm Hg were most commonly recorded and could possibly reflect normal values. The principal component analysis suggested state shifts in the physiome occurred at ICPs greater than 19 mm Hg and 24 mm Hg. Elastic net regression identified an ICP threshold of 19 mm Hg as most robustly associated with outcome when considering all neurocritical care patients, patients with TBI, and patients with TBI who underwent craniectomy. Intracranial pressure values greater than 19 mm Hg were associated with mortality, while lower values were associated with outcome in surviving patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study provides insight into what normal ICP values could be. An ICP threshold of 19 mm Hg was robustly associated with outcome in studied patients, although lower ICP values were associated with outcome in surviving patients.},

A Bayesian approach allows the calibration of p-values by transforming them to direct measures of the evidence against the null hypothesis, so-called Bayes factors. We review the available literature in this area and consider two-sided significance tests for a point null hypothesis in more detail. We distinguish simple from local alternative hypotheses and contrast traditional Bayes factors based on the data with Bayes factors based on p-values or test statistics. A well-known finding is that the minimum Bayes factor, the smallest possible Bayes factor within a certain class of alternative hypotheses, provides less evidence against the null hypothesis than the corresponding p-value might suggest. It is less known that the relationship between p-values and minimum Bayes factors also depends on the sample size and on the dimension of the parameter of interest. We illustrate the transformation of p-values to minimum Bayes factors with two examples from clinical research.},

  abstract = {The p-value quantifies the discrepancy between the data and a null hypothesis of interest, usually the assumption of no difference or no effect. A Bayesian approach allows the calibration of p-values by transforming them to direct measures of the evidence against the null hypothesis, so-called Bayes factors. We review the available literature in this area and consider two-sided significance tests for a point null hypothesis in more detail. We distinguish simple from local alternative hypotheses and contrast traditional Bayes factors based on the data with Bayes factors based on p-values or test statistics. A well-known finding is that the minimum Bayes factor, the smallest possible Bayes factor within a certain class of alternative hypotheses, provides less evidence against the null hypothesis than the corresponding p-value might suggest. It is less known that the relationship between p-values and minimum Bayes factors also depends on the sample size and on the dimension of the parameter of interest. We illustrate the transformation of p-values to minimum Bayes factors with two examples from clinical research.},

Recommendations follow the American Heart Association\&sol;American Stroke Association methods of classifying the level of certainty of the treatment effect and the class of evidence. Prerelease review of the draft guideline was performed by 6 expert peer reviewers and by the members of the Stroke Council Scientific Oversight Committee and Stroke Council Leadership Committee. Results\textemdash{} Evidence-based guidelines are presented for the care of patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage. Topics focused on diagnosis, management of coagulopathy and blood pressure, prevention and control of secondary brain injury and intracranial pressure, the role of surgery, outcome prediction, rehabilitation, secondary prevention, and future considerations. Results of new phase 3 trials were incorporated. Conclusions\textemdash{} Intracerebral hemorrhage remains a serious condition for which early aggressive care is warranted. These guidelines provide a framework for goal-directed treatment of the patient with intracerebral hemorrhage.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) constitutes 10\% to 15\% of all strokes and remains without a treatment of proven benefit. Despite several existing outcome prediction models for ICH, there is no standard clinical grading scale for ICH analogous to those for traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or ischemic stroke.Methods\textemdash Records of all patients with acute ICH presenting to the University of California, San Francisco during 1997\textendash 1998 were reviewed. Independent predictors of 30-day mortality were identified by logistic regression. A risk stratification scale (the ICH Score) was developed with weighting of independent predictors based on strength of association.Results\textemdash Factors independently associated with 30-day mortality were Glasgow Coma Scale score (P{$<$}0.001), age {$\geq$}80 years (P=0.001), infratentorial origin of ICH (P=0.03), ICH volume (P=0.047), and presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (P=0.052). The ICH Score was the sum of individual points assigned as follows: GCS score 3 to 4 (=2 points), 5 to 12 (=1), 13 to 15 (=0); age {$\geq$}80 years yes (=1), no (=0); infratentorial origin yes (=1), no (=0); ICH volume {$\geq$}30 cm3 (=1), {$<$}30 cm3 (=0); and intraventricular hemorrhage yes (=1), no (=0). All 26 patients with an ICH Score of 0 survived, and all 6 patients with an ICH Score of 5 died. Thirty-day mortality increased steadily with ICH Score (P{$<$}0.005).Conclusions\textemdash The ICH Score is a simple clinical grading scale that allows risk stratification on presentation with ICH. The use of a scale such as the ICH Score could improve standardization of clinical treatment protocols and clinical research studies in ICH.},

The goals of this study were to assess whether the ICH Score accurately stratifies patients with regard to 12-month functional outcome and to further delineate the pace of recovery of patients during the first year post-ICH. Methods: We performed a prospective observational cohort study of all patients with acute ICH admitted to the emergency departments of San Francisco General Hospital and UCSF Medical Center from June 1, 2001, through May 31, 2004. Components of the ICH Score (admission Glasgow Coma Scale score, initial hematoma volume, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage, infratentorial ICH origin, and age) were recorded along with other clinical characteristics. Patients were then assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at hospital discharge, 30 days, and 3, 6, and 12 months post-ICH. Results: Of 243 patients, 95 (39\%) died during initial acute hospitalization. The ICH Score accurately stratified patients with regard to 12-month functional outcome for various dichotomous cutpoints along the mRS (p Ͻ 0.05). Many patients continued to improve across the first year, with a small number of patients becoming disabled or dying due to late events unrelated to the initial ICH. Conclusions: The ICH Score is a valid clinical grading scale for long-term functional outcome after acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Many ICH patients improve after hospital discharge and this improvement may continue even after 6 months post-ICH. Neurology\textregistered{} 2009;73:1088 \textendash 1094},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether tocilizumab (TCZ) improves outcomes of patients hospitalized with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICPANTS This cohort-embedded, investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, bayesian randomized clinical trial investigating patients with COVID-19 and moderate or severe pneumonia requiring at least 3 L/min of oxygen but without ventilation or admission to the intensive care unit was conducted between March 31, 2020, to April 18, 2020, with follow-up through 28 days. Patients were recruited from 9 university hospitals in France. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis with no correction for multiplicity for secondary outcomes. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to receive TCZ, 8 mg/kg, intravenously plus usual care on day 1 and on day 3 if clinically indicated (TCZ group) or to receive usual care alone (UC group). Usual care included antibiotic agents, antiviral agents, corticosteroids, vasopressor support, and anticoagulants. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were scores higher than 5 on the World Health Organization 10-point Clinical Progression Scale (WHO-CPS) on day 4 and survival without need of ventilation (including noninvasive ventilation) at day 14. Secondary outcomes were clinical status assessed with the WHO-CPS scores at day 7 and day 14, overall survival, time to discharge, time to oxygen supply independency, biological factors such as C-reactive protein level, and adverse events. RESULTS Of 131 patients, 64 patients were randomly assigned to the TCZ group and 67 to UC group; 1 patient in the TCZ group withdrew consent and was not included in the analysis. Of the 130 patients, 42 were women (32\%), and median (interquartile range) age was 64 (57.1-74.3) years. In the TCZ group, 12 patients had a WHO-CPS score greater than 5 at day 4 vs 19 in the UC group (median posterior absolute risk difference [ARD] -9.0\%; 90\% credible interval [CrI], -21.0 to 3.1), with a posterior probability of negative ARD of 89.0\% not achieving the 95\% predefined efficacy threshold. At day 14, 12\% (95\% CI -28\% to 4\%) fewer patients needed noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or mechanical ventilation (MV) or died in the TCZ group than in the UC group (24\% vs 36\%, median posterior hazard ratio [HR] 0.58; 90\% CrI, 0.33-1.00), with a posterior probability of HR less than 1 of 95.0\%, achieving the predefined efficacy threshold. The HR for MV or death was 0.58 (90\% CrI, 0.30 to 1.09). At day 28, 7 patients had died in the TCZ group and 8 in the UC group (adjusted HR, 0.92; 95\% CI 0.33-2.53). Serious adverse events occurred in 20 (32\%) patients in the TCZ group and 29 (43\%) in the UC group (P = .21). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this randomized clinical trial of patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia requiring oxygen support but not admitted to the intensive care unit, TCZ did not reduce WHO-CPS scores lower than 5 at day 4 but might have reduced the risk of NIV, MV, or death by day 14. No difference on day 28 mortality was found. Further studies are necessary for confirming these preliminary results.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This observational analysis included all anticancer drug indications approved by the FDA from June 30, 2014, through July 31, 2019. All indications were investigated, and each clinical trial was evaluated for design, enrollment period, primary end points, and presence of a limitation in the domains of interest. The standard-of-care therapy was determined by evaluating the literature and published guidelines 1 year prior to the start of clinical trial enrollment. Crossover was examined and evaluated for optimal use. The percentage of approvals based on clinical trials with any or all limitations of interest was then calculated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Estimated percentage of clinical trials with limitations of interest that led to an anticancer drug marketing authorization by the FDA. RESULTS A total of 187 trials leading to 176 approvals for 75 distinct novel anticancer drugs by the FDA were evaluated. Sixty-four (34\%) were single-arm clinical trials, and 123 (63\%) were randomized clinical trials. A total of 125 (67\%) had at least 1 limitation in the domains of interest; 60 of the 125 trials (48\%) were randomized clinical trials. Of all 123 randomized clinical trials, 37 (30\%) lacked overall survival benefit, 31 (25\%) had a suboptimal control, and 17 (14\%) used crossover inappropriately. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Two-thirds of cancer drugs are approved based on clinical trials with limitations in at least 1 of 4 essential domains. Efforts to minimize these limitations at the time of clinical trial design are essential to ensure that new anticancer drugs truly improve patient outcomes over current standards.},

We sampled hospitalized adult patients who received intensive care and then compared patients who underwent cEEG to those who did not. We considered diagnostic subgroups of seizure/status epilepticus, subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage, and altered consciousness. Outcomes were in-hospital mortality, hospitalization cost, and length of stay. Results In total, 7,102,399 critically ill patients were identified, of whom 22,728 received cEEG. From 2004 to 2013, the proportion of patients who received cEEG increased from 0.06\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.03\%\textendash 0.09\%) to 0.80\% (95\% CI 0.62\%\textendash 0.98\%). While the cEEG cohort appeared more ill, cEEG use was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality after adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95\% CI 0.75\textendash 0.93, p {$<$} 0.001). This finding held for the diagnoses of subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage and for altered consciousness but not for the seizure/status epilepticus subgroup.

  abstract = {Object.               By pursuing a policy of very early aneurysm treatment in neurosurgical centers, in-hospital rebleeds can be virtually eliminated. Nonetheless, as many as 15\% of patients with aneurysm rupture suffer ultraearly rebleeding with high mortality rates, and these individuals are beyond the reach of even the most ambitious protocol for diagnosis and referral. Only drugs given immediately after the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has been established at the local hospital level can, in theory, contribute to the minimization of such ultraearly rebleeding. The object of this randomized, prospective, multicenter study was to assess the efficacy of short-term antifibrinolytic treatment with tranexamic acid in preventing rebleeding.                                         Methods.               Only patients suffering SAH verified on computerized tomography (CT) scans within 48 hours prior to the first hospital admission were included. A 1-g dose of tranexamic acid was given intravenously as soon as diagnosis of SAH had been verified in the local hospitals (before the patients were transported), followed by doses of 1 g every 6 hours until the aneurysm was occluded; this treatment did not exceed 72 hours. In this study, 254 patients received tranexamic acid and 251 patients were randomized as controls. Age, sex, Hunt and Hess and Fisher grade distributions, as well as aneurysm locations, were congruent between the groups. Outcome was assessed at 6 months post-SAH by using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Vasospasm and delayed ischemic neurological deficits were classified according to clinical findings as well as by transcranial Doppler (TCD) studies. All events classified as rebleeding were verified on CT scans or during surgery.                                         Conclusions.               More than 90\% of patients reached the neurosurgical center within 12 hours of their first hospital admission after SAH; 70\% of all aneurysms were clipped or coils were inserted within 24 hours of the first hospital admission. Given the protocol, only one rebleed occurred later than 24 hours after the first hospital admission. Despite this strong emphasis on early intervention, however, a cluster of 27 very early rebleeds still occurred in the control group within hours of randomization into the study, and 13 of these patients died. In the tranexamic acid group, six patients rebled and two died. A reduction in the rebleeding rate from 10.8 to 2.4\% and an 80\% reduction in the mortality rate from early rebleeding with tranexamic acid treatment can therefore be inferred. Favorable outcome according to the GOS increased from 70.5 to 74.8\%. According to TCD measurements and clinical findings, there were no indications of increased risk of either ischemic clinical manifestations or vasospasm that could be linked to tranexamic acid treatment. Neurosurgical guidelines for aneurysm rupture should extend also into the preneurosurgical phase to guarantee protection from ultraearly rebleeds. Currently available antifibrinolytic drugs can provide such protection, and at low cost. The number of potentially saved lives exceeds those lost to vasospasm.},

  abstract = {There is little doubt that decompressive craniectomy can reduce mortality however, the results of a recent study has provided more evidence to inform the debate regarding clinical and ethical concerns that it merely converts death into survival with severe disability or in a vegetative state. The recently published RESCUEicp trial compared last-tier secondary decompressive craniectomy with continued medical management for refractory intracranial hypertension after severe traumatic brain injury. Patients were randomly assigned to decompressive craniectomy with medical therapy or to receive continued medical therapy with the option of adding barbiturates. The results of the study support the findings of the stroke studies in that the reduction in mortality was almost directly translatable into survival with either severe disability or in a vegetative state. The question remains as to whether there is a subset of patients who obtain benefit from surgical decompression and it is in this regard that the use of observational cohort studies and sophisticated outcome prediction models may be of use. Comparing the percentage prediction with the observed long outcome provides an objective assessment of the most likely outcome can be obtained for patients thought to require surgical intervention. Whilst there will always be limitations when using this type of data they may help prompt appropriate patient-centred discussions regarding realistic outcome expectations. A broader debate is also needed regarding use of a medical intervention that may leave a person in a condition that they may feel to be unacceptable and also places a considerable burden on society.},

OBJECTIVE: To assess opinion on consent and acceptable outcome among a wide range of healthcare workers. METHODS: Seven hundred seventy-three healthcare workers at the 2 major public neurosurgical centers in Western Australia participated. Participants were asked to record their opinion on consent and acceptable outcome based on the modified Rankin Score (mRS). The evidence for clinical efficacy of the procedure was presented, and participants were then asked to reconsider their initial responses. RESULTS: Of the 773 participants included in the study, 407 (52.7\%) initially felt that they would provide consent for a decompressive craniectomy as a lifesaving procedure, but only a minority of them considered an mRS score of 4 or 5 an acceptable outcome (for mRS score \#4, n = 67, 8.7\%; for mRS score = 4, n = 57, 7.4\%). After the introduction of the concept of the disability paradox and the evidence for the clinical efficacy of decompressive craniectomy, more participants were unwilling to accept decompressive craniectomy (18.1\% vs 37.8\%), but at the same time, more were willing to accept an mRS score \#4 as an acceptable outcome (for mRS score \#4, n = 92, 11.9\%; for mRS score = 4, n = 79, 10.2\%). CONCLUSION: Most participants felt survival with dependency to be unacceptable. However, many would be willing to provide consent for surgery in the hopes that they may survive with some degree of independence.},

  abstract = {Learning about cause and effect is arguably the main goal in applied econometrics. In practice, the validity of these causal inferences is contingent on a number of critical assumptions regarding the type of data that has been collected and the substantive knowledge that is available. For instance, unobserved confounding factors threaten the internal validity of estimates, data availability is often limited to non-random, selection-biased samples, causal effects need to be learned from surrogate experiments with imperfect compliance, and causal knowledge has to be extrapolated across structurally heterogeneous populations. A powerful causal inference framework is required to tackle these challenges, which plague most data analysis to varying degrees. Building on the structural approach to causality introduced by Haavelmo (1943) and the graph-theoretic framework proposed by Pearl (1995), the artificial intelligence (AI) literature has developed a wide array of techniques for causal learning that allow to leverage information from various imperfect, heterogeneous, and biased data sources (Bareinboim and Pearl, 2016). In this paper, we discuss recent advances in this literature that have the potential to contribute to econometric methodology along three dimensions. First, they provide a unified and comprehensive framework for causal inference, in which the aforementioned problems can be addressed in full generality. Second, due to their origin in AI, they come together with sound, efficient, and complete algorithmic criteria for automatization of the corresponding identification task. And third, because of the nonparametric description of structural models that graph-theoretic approaches build on, they combine the strengths of both structural econometrics as well as the potential outcomes framework, and thus offer an effective middle ground between these two literature streams.},

  abstract = {Objective: To compare the performance of formal prognostic instruments vs subjective clinical judgment with regards to predicting functional outcome in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Methods: This prospective observational study enrolled 121 ICH patients hospitalized at 5 US tertiary care centers. Within 24 hours of each patient's admission to the hospital, one physician and one nurse on each patient's clinical team were each asked to predict the patient's modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 3 months and to indicate whether he or she would recommend comfort measures. The admission ICH score and FUNC score, 2 prognostic scales selected for their common use in neurologic practice, were calculated for each patient. Spearman rank correlation coefficients (r) with respect to patients' actual 3-month mRS for the physician and nursing predictions were compared against the same correlation coefficients for the ICH score and FUNC score. Results: The absolute value of the correlation coefficient for physician predictions with respect to actual outcome (0.75) was higher than that of either the ICH score (0.62, p = 0.057) or the FUNC score (0.56, p = 0.01). The nursing predictions of outcome (r = 0.72) also trended towards an accuracy advantage over the ICH score (p = 0.09) and FUNC score (p = 0.03). In an analysis that excluded patients for whom comfort care was recommended, the 65 available attending physician predictions retained greater accuracy (r = 0.73) than either the ICH score (r = 0.50, p = 0.02) or the FUNC score (r = 0.42, p = 0.004). Conclusions: Early subjective clinical judgment of physicians correlates more closely with 3-month outcome after ICH than prognostic scales.},

  abstract = {Objective To determine whether groups of surrogates for patients with severe acute brain injury (SABI) with poor prognosis can be identified based on their prioritization of goals-of-care (GOC) decisional concerns, an online survey of 1,588 adults recruited via a probability-based panel representative of the US population was conducted. Methods Participants acted as a surrogate for a GOC decision for a hypothetical patient with SABI and were randomized to 1 of 2 prognostic scenarios: the patient likely being left with a range of severe functional disability (SD) or remaining in a vegetative state (VS). Participants prioritized a list of 12 decisional concerns via best-worst scaling. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to discover decisional groups. Results The completion rate was 44.6\%; data weighting was conducted to mitigate nonresponse bias. For 792 SD respondents, LCA revealed 4 groups. All groups shared concerns regarding respecting patient wishes and minimizing suffering. The 4 groups were otherwise distinguished by unique concerns that their members highlighted: an older adult remaining severely disabled (34.4\%), family consensus (26.4\%), doubt regarding prognostic accuracy (20.7\%), and cost of long-term care (18.6\%). For the 796 VS respondents, LCA revealed 5 groups. Four of the 5 groups had similar concern profiles to the 4 SD groups. The largest (29.0\%) expressed the most prognostic doubt. An additional group (15.8\%) prioritized religious concerns. Conclusions Although surrogate decision makers for patients with SABI are concerned with respecting patient wishes and minimizing suffering, certain groups highly prioritize other specific decisional factors. These data can help inform future interventions for supporting decision makers.},

  abstract = {A number of neurologic disorders can cause cardiac dysfunction by involving the conductive system and contractile apparatus of the heart. This is especially prominent in the neurocritical care setting where the spectrum of cardiac dysfunction due to acute neurologic injury ranges from trivial and isolated electrocardiographic changes to malignant arrhythmias and sudden death (Table 1). The mechanism of these cardiac complications is complex and not fully understood. An understanding of the neuroanatomical structures and pathways is of immense importance to comprehend the underlying pathophysiology that culminates as cardiac damage and dysregulation. Once the process is initiated, it can complicate and adversely affect the outcome of primary neurologic conditions commonly seen in the neurocritical care setting. Not only are these cardiac disorders under-recognized, there is a paucity of data to formulate evidence-based guidelines regarding early detection, acute management, and preventive strategies. However, certain details of clinical features and their course combined with location of primary neurologic lesion on neuroimaging and data obtained from laboratory investigations can be of great value to develop a strategy to appropriately manage these patients and to prevent adverse outcome from these cardiac complications. In this review, we highlight the mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction due to catastrophic neurologic conditions or due to stress of critical illness. We also address various clinical syndromes of cardiac dysfunction that occur as a result of the neurologic illness and in turn may complicate the course of the primary neurologic condition.},

  abstract = {Background: Cerebral sinus venous thrombosis (CSVT) is a relatively rare, potentially fatal neurological condition that can be frequently overlooked due to the vague nature of its clinical and radiological presentation. A literature search on PubMed using the keyword ``Cerebral sinus venous thrombosis'' was performed. We searched for the epidemiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of CSVT. All full-text articles in the last 10 years, in adults ({$>$}18 years), and the English language were included. We aim to give a comprehensive review of CSVT, with a primary focus on the management of the disease. Summary: The literature search revealed 404 articles that met our criteria. CSVT is a relatively rare condition that accounts for approximately 1\% of all forms of stroke. They can be subdivided into acute, subacute, and chronic forms based on the time of onset of clinical symptoms. It is a multifactorial disease, and the major forms of clinical presentation include isolated intracranial hypertension syndrome, focal neurological deficits, and cavernous sinus syndrome. MRI with magnetic resonance venogram (MRV) is considered the gold standard for diagnosis. Anticoagulation with heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin is the mainstay of treatment. Endovascular management is indicated for those cases with severe symptoms or worsening of symptoms despite anticoagulation therapy. Favorable outcomes have been reported in patients who receive early diagnosis and treatment. Conclusion: CSVT is a potentially fatal neurological condition that is often under-diagnosed due to its nonspecific presentation. Timely diagnosis and treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality, remarkably improving the outcome in affected individuals.},

We performed a nationwide study to examine whether CSC capabilities influenced in-hospital mortality of patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Of the 1,369 certified training institutions in Japan, 749 hospitals responded to a questionnaire survey regarding CSC capabilities that queried the availability of personnel, diagnostic techniques, specific expertise, infrastructure, and educational components recommended for CSCs. Among the institutions that responded, data on patients hospitalized for stroke between April 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011 were obtained from the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database. In-hospital mortality was analyzed using hierarchical logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, level of consciousness on admission, comorbidities, and the number of fulfilled CSC items in each component and in total. Data from 265 institutions and 53,170 emergency-hospitalized patients were analyzed. Mortality rates were 7.8\% for patients with ischemic stroke, 16.8\% for patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and 28.1\% for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Mortality adjusted for age, sex, and level of consciousness was significantly correlated with personnel, infrastructural, educational, and total CSC scores in patients with ischemic stroke. Mortality was significantly correlated with diagnostic, educational, and total CSC scores in patients with ICH and with specific expertise, infrastructural, educational, and total CSC scores in patients with SAH. CSC capabilities were associated with reduced in-hospital mortality rates, and relevant aspects of care were found to be dependent on stroke type.}

We aimed to determine the predictors of admission, length of stay, and outcome for ICU among participants of the main Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial (INTERACT2). INTERACT2 was an international, open, blinded endpoint, randomized controlled trial of 2839 ICH patients ({$<$}6 h) and elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) allocated to receive intensive (target SBP {$<$}140 mmHg within 1 h) or guideline-recommended (target SBP {$<$}180 mmHg) BP-lowering treatment. The primary outcome was death or major disability, defined by modified Rankin scale scores 3\textendash 6 at 90 days. Logistic regression and propensity score analyses were used to determine independent associations. Predictors of ICU admission included younger age, recruitment in China, prior ischemic/undetermined stroke, high SBP, severe stroke [National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) score {$\geq$}15], large ICH volume ({$\geq$}15 mL), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) extension, early neurological deterioration, intubation and surgery. Determinants of prolonged ICU stay ({$\geq$}5 days) were prior antihypertensive use, NIHSS {$\geq$}15, large ICH volume, lobar ICH location, IVH, early neurological deterioration, intubation and surgery. ICU admission was associated with higher-risk major disability at 90-day assessment compared to those without ICU admission. This study presents prognostic variables for ICU management and outcome of ICH patients included in a large international cohort. These data may assist in the selection and counseling of patients and families concerning ICU admission.}

Design, Setting, and Patients A prospective cohort involving 1194 patients with 1520 hospitalizations for severe sepsis drawn from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative survey of US residents (1998-2006). A total of 9223 respondents had a baseline cognitive and functional assessment and had linked Medicare claims; 516 survived severe sepsis and 4517 survived a nonsepsis hospitalization to at least 1 follow-up survey and are included in the analysis. Main Outcome Measures Personal interviews were conducted with respondents or proxies using validated surveys to assess the presence of cognitive impairment and to determine the number of activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ADLs (IADLs) for which patients needed assistance. Results Survivors' mean age at hospitalization was 76.9 years. The prevalence of moderate to severe cognitive impairment increased 10.6 percentage points among patients who survived severe sepsis, an odds ratio (OR) of 3.34 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.53-7.25) in multivariable regression. Likewise, a high rate of new functional limitations was seen following sepsis: in those with no limits before sepsis, a mean 1.57 new limitations (95\% CI, 0.99-2.15); and for those with mild to moderate limitations before sepsis, a mean of 1.50 new limitations (95\% CI, 0.87-2.12). In contrast, nonsepsis general hospitalizations were associated with no change in moderate to severe cognitive impairment (OR, 1.15; 95\% CI, 0.80-1.67; P for difference vs sepsis=.01) and with the development of fewer new limitations (mean among those with no limits before hospitalization, 0.48; 95\% CI, 0.39-0.57; P for difference vs sepsis Ͻ.001 and mean among those with mild to moderate limits, 0.43; 95\% CI, 0.23-0.63; P for difference=.001). The declines in cognitive and physical function persisted for at least 8 years. Conclusions Severe sepsis in this older population was independently associated with substantial and persistent new cognitive impairment and functional disability among survivors. The magnitude of these new deficits was large, likely resulting in a pivotal downturn in patients' ability to live independently.},

Sixty patients received 120 bolus infusions of mannitol (0.18-2.5 g/kg/ dose) with a prompt peak reduction at 44 minutes (range 18 to 120 minutes). There was no relationship between dosage and rapidity of peak response. All administrations of 1.0g/kg/dose, or higher, consistently reduced ICP 10\% or more from control values, but dosages below 1 gm/kg/dose did not always reduce ICP. Return to control ICP following mannitol was unpredictable, and was related to the initial ICP and the volume of fluid replacement. A continuous infusion of mannitol was administered to maintain ICP below 25 torr in 18 patients. This infusion ranged from 6 to 100 hours (\textbullet{} 28.8 + 28.9 hours) and required a total dosage of 2-20 mg/kg, and was successful in 16 of the 18 patients.

  abstract = {Objectives: The objective of this study was to study the impact of ignoring uncertainty by forcing dichotomous classification (presence or absence) of the target disease on estimates of diagnostic accuracy of an index test. Study Design and Setting: We evaluated the bias in estimated index test accuracy when forcing an expert panel to make a dichotomous target disease classification for each individual. Data for various scenarios with expert panels were simulated by varying the number and accuracy of ``component reference tests'' available to the expert panel, index test sensitivity and specificity, and target disease prevalence. Results: Index test accuracy estimates are likely to be biased when there is uncertainty surrounding the presence or absence of the target disease. Direction and amount of bias depend on the number and accuracy of component reference tests, target disease prevalence, and the true values of index test sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion: In this simulation, forcing expert panels to make a dichotomous decision on target disease classification in the presence of uncertainty leads to biased estimates of index test accuracy. Empirical studies are needed to demonstrate whether this bias can be reduced by assigning a probability of target disease presence for each individual, or using advanced statistical methods to account for uncertainty in target disease classification. \'O 2019 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Surgeries for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remain controversial. Our previous study found that postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow was associated with high hematoma evacuation efficiency in ICH cases with intraventricular involvement (ICHV) treated with minimally invasive craniopuncture (MIC). This study was designed to identify factors that predict postoperative CSF outflow and the specific subtype of ICHV that may benefit from MIC. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} A total of 189 MIC needles applied to 125 ICHV patients were retrospectively analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify independent predictive factors of postoperative CSF outflow. Results:\hspace{0.6em} A density of the whole hematoma of\,{$\leq$}\,59 HU [odds ratio (OR)\,=\,8.572, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 3.235\textendash 22.714, P\,{$<$}\,0.001, standardization regression coefficients B{${'}$}\,=\,0.576] and a distance between the needle tip and the ventricular tear (tip-tear distance) of 21.79\textendash 34.15 mm (OR\,=\,25.566, 95\% CI 8.707\textendash 75.074, P\,{$<$}\,0.001, B{${'}$}\,=\,0.883) were identified as independent predictive factors of postoperative CSF outflow. The density of the hematoma within 34.15 mm of the tear (clot 3.4) showed no statistical difference from that of the whole hematoma (P\,=\,0.571). A density of clot 3.4\,{$\leq$}\,60 HU was also a predictive factor of postoperative CSF outflow (area under curve: 0.771). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} ICHV patients who meet the following conditions may benefit from MIC: (1) The MIC needle tip can be placed in the hematoma 21.79\textendash 34.15 mm from the ventricular tear; (2) the density of the whole hematoma is low ({$\leq$}\,59 HU); and (3) the density of clot 3.4 is also low ({$\leq$}\,60 HU). Future perspective studies should be conducted on this specific patient subtype.},

  abstract = {Background: Since the approval of the oral factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors, there have been concerns regarding the ability to neutralize their anticoagulant effects after intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Multiple guidelines suggest using prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) in these patients based upon research that includes a limited number of patients with ICH. Given this, we aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PCC for FXa inhibitor-related ICH in a large, multicenter cohort of patients. Methods: This was a multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study of patients with apixaban or rivaroxaban-related ICH who received PCC between January 1, 2015 and March 1, 2019. The study had two primary analysis groups: safety and hemostatic efficacy. The safety analysis evaluated all patients meeting inclusion criteria for the occurrence of a thrombotic event, which were censored at hospital discharge or 30 days following PCC administration. Patients with intracerebral, subarachnoid, or subdural hemorrhages who had at least one follow-up image within 24 hours of PCC administration were assessed for hemostatic efficacy. The primary efficacy outcome was the percentage of patients with excellent or good hemostasis based upon the modified Sarode criteria. Secondary outcomes included an evaluation of in-hospital mortality, length of stay, infusion-related reactions and thrombotic event occurrence during multiple pre-defined periods. Results: A total of 663 patients were included and assessed for safety outcomes. Of these, 433 patients met criteria for hemostatic efficacy evaluation. We observed excellent or good hemostasis in 354 patients (81.8\%; 95\% confidence interval 77.9 \textendash{} 85.2). Twenty-five (3.8\%) patients had a total of 26 thrombotic events, of which 22 occurred in the first 14 days following PCC administration. One patient had documentation of an infusion-related reaction. For the full cohort of patients, in-hospital mortality was 19.0\% and the median intensive care unit and hospital length of stay were 2.0 and 6.0 days, respectively. Conclusions: Administration of PCC after apixaban and rivaroxaban-related ICH provided a high rate of excellent or good hemostasis (81.8\%) coupled with a 3.8\% thrombosis rate. Randomized, controlled trials evaluating the clinical efficacy of PCC in patients with FXa inhibitor-related ICH are needed.},

Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Data from the National Inpatient Sample, from 2002 to 2012. Patients: Adult patients with SABI defined as a primary diagnosis of stroke, traumatic brain injury, or post-cardiac arrest who received greater than 96 hours of mechanical ventilation. Exposure: Race/ethnicity, stratified into 5 categories (white, black, Hispanic, Asian, and other). Measurements and Main Results: Data from 86 246 patients were included in the cohort, with a mean (standard deviation) age of 60 (18) years. In multivariable analysis, compared to white patients, black patients had an 20\% increased risk of tracheostomy utilization (relative risk [RR]: 1.20, 95\% CI: 1.16-1.24, P {$<$} .001), Hispanic patients had a 10\% increased risk (RR: 1.10, 95\% CI: 1.06-1.14, P {$<$} .001), Asian patients had an 8\% increased risk (RR: 1.08, 95\% CI: 1.01-1.16, P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .02), and other race patients had an 10\% increased risk (RR: 1.10, 95\% CI: 1.04-1.16, P {$<$} .001). A similar relationship was observed for gastrostomy utilization. In multivariable analysis, compared to white patients, black patients had a 25\% decreased risk of hospice discharge (RR: 0.75, 95\% CI: 0.67-0.85, P {$<$} .001), Hispanic patients had a 20\% decreased risk (RR: 0.80, 95\% CI: 0.69-0.94, P {$<$} .01), and Asian patients had a 47\% decreased risk (RR: 0.53, 95\% CI: 0.39-0.73, P {$<$} .001). There was no observed relationship between race/ethnicity and in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: Minority race was associated with increased utilization of tracheostomy and gastrostomy, as well as decreased hospice utilization among patients with SABI.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) launched the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPCI) initiative in 2013. A subsequent study showed that the initiative was associated with reductions in Medicare payments for total joint replacement, but little is known about the effect of BPCI on medical conditions. METHODS We used Medicare claims from 2013 through 2015 to identify admissions for the five most commonly selected medical conditions in BPCI: congestive heart failure (CHF), pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sepsis, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We used difference-in-differences analyses to assess changes in standardized Medicare payments per episode of care (defined as the hospitalization plus 90 days after discharge) for these conditions at BPCI hospitals and matched control hospitals. RESULTS A total of 125 hospitals participated in BPCI for CHF, 105 hospitals for pneumonia, 101 hospitals for COPD, 88 hospitals for sepsis, and 73 hospitals for AMI. At baseline, the average Medicare payment per episode of care across the five conditions at BPCI hospitals was \$24,280, which decreased to \$23,993 during the intervention period (difference, -\$286; P\,=\,0.41). Control hospitals had an average payment for all episodes of \$23,901, which decreased to \$23,503 during the intervention period (difference, -\$398; P\,=\,0.08; difference in differences, \$112; P\,=\,0.79). Changes from baseline to the intervention period in clinical complexity, length of stay, emergency department use or readmission within 30 or 90 days after hospital discharge, or death within 30 or 90 days after admission did not differ significantly between the intervention and control hospitals. CONCLUSIONS Hospital participation in five common medical bundles under BPCI was not associated with significant changes in Medicare payments, clinical complexity, length of stay, emergency department use, hospital readmission, or mortality.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The two most commonly used aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage grading scales are the Hunt and Hess and World Federation of Neurological Societies scales. Neither has achieved universal acceptance, however, owing to concerns regarding either subjectivity or lack of correlation with outcomes, respectively. A grading scale based entirely on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was recently proposed. We have prospectively evaluated the GCS grading system and compared it with the Hunt and Hess and World Federation of Neurological Societies scales for predictive accuracy. METHODS: Data from 1532 consecutive patients with intracranial aneurysms admitted to our institution between January 1991 and June 2005 were analyzed. The Glasgow Outcome Scale was the primary outcome measure. Mortality and length of stay were secondary measures. The scales were evaluated using simple and multivariable logistic and linear regression. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess predictive accuracy for the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Prognostic factors were assessed with ordinal multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: The GCS grading system was most strongly associated with all outcome measures and was the strongest predictor of mortality and persistent vegetative state. Age, vasospasm, hydrocephalus, and intracranial hematoma were found to be significant prognostic elements. CONCLUSION: The GCS grading system is more strongly associated with outcomes than either the Hunt and Hess or World Federation of Neurological Societies scales, and it is an equivalent to a slightly better predictor of Glasgow Outcome Scale outcomes. Its simplicity, proven inter-rater reliability, and wide level of familiarity among health care personnel render the GCS grading system a superior grading scale for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage severity, warranting its consideration for universal use.},

We report here the 30-day mortality and 6- and 12-month functional outcomes from the DESTINY trial. Methods\textemdash DESTINY (ISRCTN01258591) is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, clinical trial based on a sequential design that used mortality after 30 days as the first end point. When this end point was reached, patient enrollment was interrupted as per protocol until recalculation of the projected sample size was performed on the basis of the 6-month outcome (primary end pointϭmodified Rankin Scale score, dichotomized to 0 to 3 versus 4 to 6). All analyses were based on intention to treat. Results\textemdash A statistically significant reduction in mortality was reached after 32 patients had been included: 15 of 17 (88\%) patients randomized to hemicraniectomy versus 7 of 15 (47\%) patients randomized to conservative therapy survived after 30 days (Pϭ0.02). After 6 and 12 months, 47\% of patients in the surgical arm versus 27\% of patients in the conservative treatment arm had a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 3 (Pϭ0.23). Conclusions\textemdash DESTINY showed that hemicraniectomy reduces mortality in large hemispheric stroke. With 32 patients included, the primary end point failed to demonstrate statistical superiority of hemicraniectomy, and the projected sample size was calculated to 188 patients. Despite this failure to meet the primary end point, the steering committee decided to terminate the trial in light of the results of the joint analysis of the 3 European hemicraniectomy trials.

Methods\textemdash In this retrospective single-center study 56 consecutive patients with acute space-occupying cerebellar infarction treated surgically between 1996 and 2005 were included. Baseline data included clinical findings, Glasgow Coma Scale on admission and before surgery, NIHSS on admission, mass effects on neuroimaging, and surgical treatment strategies. Modified Rankin Scale, NIHSS, and Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia were used to assess outcome. Results\textemdash 39.3\% of patients had died, 51.8\% had a mRS Յ3, 35.7\% had a mRS Յ2, 28.6\% had a mRS Յ1. There were no significant differences in survival between treatment groups. In multivariate analysis age and mRS score at discharge were the most evident independent predictors for outcome. Conclusions\textemdash So far this is the largest study on long-term outcome after space-occupying cerebellar infarction. The value of different treatment strategies and prognostic factors for patient selection remain unclear and should be evaluated in larger prospective case-series or registries. To investigate the issue of preventive SDC randomized trials are needed. (Stroke. 2009;40:3060-3066.)},

We created and validated a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) score, adapted to Japanese circumstances. Of the selected 1369 certified training institutions in Japan, 749 completed an acute stroke care capabilities survey. Hospital performance was determined using a 25-item score, evaluating 5 subcategories: personnel, diagnostic techniques, specific expertise, infrastructure, and education. Consistency and validity were examined using correlation coefficients and factorial analysis. The CSC score (median, 14; interquartile range, 11\textendash 18) varied according to hospital volume. The five subcategories showed moderate consistency (Cronbach's {$\alpha$} = 0.765). A strong correlation existed between types of available personnel and specific expertise. Using the 2011 Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database for patients hospitalized with stroke, four constructs were identified by factorial analysis (neurovascular surgery and intervention, vascular neurology, diagnostic neuroradiology, and neurocritical care and rehabilitation) that affected in-hospital mortality from ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The total CSC score was related to in-hospital mortality from ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR], 0.973; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.958\textendash 0.989), intracerebral hemorrhage (OR, 0.970; 95\% CI, 0.950\textendash 0.990), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (OR, 0.951; 95\% CI, 0.925\textendash 0.977), with varying contributions from the four constructs. The CSC score is a valid measure for assessing CSC capabilities, based on the availability of neurovascular surgery and intervention, vascular neurology, diagnostic neuroradiology, and critical care and rehabilitation services.}

Study Design and Setting For 100 randomised trials published in 2018 and indexed in PubMed we evaluated how often a pre-specified statistical analysis approach for the trial's primary outcome was publicly available. For each trial with an available pre-specified analysis, we compared this to the trial publication to identify whether there were unexplained discrepancies. Results Only 11 of 100 trials (11\%) had a publicly available pre-specified analysis approach for their primary outcome; this document was dated before recruitment began for only one trial. Of the 11 trials with an available pre-specified analysis approach, 10 (91\%) had one or more unexplained discrepancies. Only 4/100 trials (4\%) stated that the statistician was blinded until the SAP was signed off and only 10/100 (10\%) stated the statistician was blinded until the database was locked. Conclusion For most published trials, there is insufficient information available to determine whether results may be subject to p-hacking. Where information was available, there were often unexplained discrepancies between the pre-specified and final analysis methods.},

Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Methods We identified all large NHLBI supported RCTs between 1970 and 2012 evaluating drugs or dietary supplements for the treatment or prevention of cardiovascular disease. Trials were included if direct costs {$>\$$}500,000/year, participants were adult humans, and the primary outcome was cardiovascular risk, disease or death. The 55 trials meeting these criteria were coded for whether they were published prior to or after the year 2000, whether they registered in clinicaltrials.gov prior to publication, used active or placebo comparator, and whether or not the trial had industry co-sponsorship. We tabulated whether the study reported a positive, negative, or null result on the primary outcome variable and for total mortality. Results 17 of 30 studies (57\%) published prior to 2000 showed a significant benefit of intervention on the primary outcome in comparison to only 2 among the 25 (8\%) trials published after 2000 ({$\chi$}2=12.2,df= 1, p=0.0005). There has been no change in the proportion of trials that compared treatment to placebo versus active comparator.

  abstract = {To continuously process neural activity underlying sensation, movement and cognition, the CNS requires a homeostatic microenvironment that is not only enriched in nutrients to meet its high metabolic demands but that is also devoid of toxins that might harm the sensitive neural tissues. This highly regulated microenvironment is made possible by two unique features of CNS vasculature absent in the peripheral organs. First, the blood\textendash blood barrier, which partitions the circulating blood from the CNS, acts as a gatekeeper to facilitate the selective trafficking of substances between the blood and the parenchyma. Second, neurovascular coupling ensures that, following local neural activation, regional blood flow is increased to quickly supply more nutrients and remove metabolic waste. Here, we review how neural and vascular activity act on one another with regard to these two properties.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Accumulating evidence from randomized controlled clinical trials suggests that tenecteplase may represent an effective treatment alternative to alteplase for acute ischemic stroke. In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we sought to compare the efficacy and safety outcomes of intravenous tenecteplase to intravenous alteplase administration for acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusions (LVOs). METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online) and Scopus for published randomized controlled clinical trials providing outcomes of acute ischemic stroke with confirmed LVO receiving intravenous thrombolysis with either tenecteplase at different doses or alteplase at a standard dose of 0.9 mg/kg. The primary outcome was the odds of modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 at 3 months. RESULTS: We included 4 randomized controlled clinical trials including a total of 433 patients. Patients with confirmed LVO receiving tenecteplase had higher odds of modified Rankin Scale scores of 0 to 2 (odds ratio, 2.06 [95\% CI, 1.15\textendash 3.69]), successful recanalization (odds ratio, 3.05 [95\% CI, 1.73\textendash 5.40]), and functional improvement defined as 1-point decrease across all modified Rankin Scale grades (common odds ratio, 1.84 [95\% CI, 1.18\textendash 2.87]) at 3 months compared with patients with confirmed LVO receiving alteplase. There was little or no heterogeneity between the results provided from included studies regarding the aforementioned outcomes (I2{$\leq$}20\%). No difference in the outcomes of early neurological improvement, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, any intracranial hemorrhage, and the rates of modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 1 or all-cause mortality at 3 months was detected between patients with LVO receiving intravenous thrombolysis with either tenecteplase or alteplase. CONCLUSIONS: Acute ischemic stroke patients with LVO receiving intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase have significantly better recanalization and clinical outcomes compared with patients receiving intravenous alteplase.},

  abstract = {Severe cerebral contusion is often associated with nonhemorrhagic mass effect that progresses rapidly within 12 to 48 hours posttrauma. The mechanisms underlying such a rapid progression of mass effect cannot be fully explained by classic concepts of vasogenic and cytotoxic brain edema. Data from previous clinical trials, including diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging studies, have indicated that cells in the central (core) area of the contusion undergo shrinkage, disintegration, and homogenization, whereas cellular swelling is located predominately in the peripheral (rim) area during this period. The authors hypothesized that high osmolality within the contused brain tissue generates an osmotic potential across the central and peripheral areas or causes blood to accumulate a large amount of water. To elucidate the role of tissue osmolality in contusion edema, they investigated changes in tissue osmolality, specific gravity, and ion concentration in contused brain in both experimental and clinical settings. Their results demonstrated that cerebral contusion induced a rapid increase in tissue osmolality from a baseline level of 311.4 {$\pm$} 11.3 to 402.8 {$\pm$} 15.1 mOsm at 12 hours posttrauma (p {$<$} 0.0001). Specific gravity in tissue significantly decreased from 1.0425 {$\pm$} 0.0026 to 1.0308 {$\pm$} 0.0028 (p {$<$} 0.01), reflecting water accumulation in contused tissue. The total ionic concentration [Na               +               ] + [K               +               ] + [Cl               -               ] did not change significantly at any time point. Inorganic ions do not primarily contribute to this elevation in osmolality, suggesting that the increase in colloid osmotic pressure through the metabolic production of osmoles or the release of idiogenic osmoles can be a main cause of contusion edema.},

  abstract = {Background: The association between clinician- and patient-reported health status measures (HSM) after hemicraniectomy for ischemic stroke is understudied. We compared HSMs to determine how HSM type and follow-up affect the interpretation of outcomes. Methods: We identified patients that underwent hemicraniectomy for ischemic stroke at the Cleveland Clinic (CC) from January 2009 through May 2013. HSMs were obtained from the CC Knowledge Program Data Registry. Outpatient follow-up was divided into ``Early'' (3 {$\pm$} 2 months (standard deviation)) and ``Late'' (9 {$\pm$} 3 months) time periods. Clinician-reported HSMs (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)) were compared to patient-reported HSMs (EuroQol quality of life index (EQ-5D), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Stroke Impact Scale-16 (SIS-16)). Results: 11 of 32 patients completed all HSMs during both follow-up periods. Clinician-reported median NIHSS scores improved from 12 to 7 (p = 0.003). Median mRS scores demonstrated little improvement from 4 to 3 (p = 0.2). Patient-reported median EQ-5D scores improved from 0.33 to 0.69 (p = 0.03). Among EQ-5D sub-scores, ``usual activity'' improved from a median score of 3 (extreme problems) to 2 (some problems) (p = 0.008). Median PHQ-9 scores improved from 9 to 1 (p = 0.06) as did SIS-16 scores from 23 to 57 (p = 0.01). EQ-5D and mRS score differences between periods were correlated (r = -0.65, p = 0.03), but only the EQ-5D showed significant improvement over time. Conclusions: Both HSM types, clinician- and patient-reported outcome measures, improved over time. The structure of clinical trials, and, in particular, defining clinical endpoints and framing outcomes, has a profound impact on the interpretation of what a ``favorable'' outcome means.},

Whether in-hospital stroke mortality is reflective of deviations from evidencebased practices or patient/family preferences on life-sustaining measures is unclear. Methods: All ischemic stroke mortalities at an academic medical center were reviewed to better understand the causes of inpatient stroke mortality. Results: Among 37 deaths or discharges to hospice in 2009, 36 occurred after a patient/family decision to withdraw/withhold potentially life-sustaining interventions. An independent survey of 3 vascular neurologists revealed that some early deaths could have been delayed beyond 30 days if patients or families had agreed to more aggressive measures. From these data, we estimate the magnitude of a ``withdrawal of care'' bias to be approximately 40\% of the observed short-term mortality.

  abstract = {Decision making for patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) poses several challenges. Outcomes in this patient population are generally poor, prognostication is often uncertain, and treatment strategies offer limited benefits. Studies demonstrate variability in the type and intensity of treatment offered, which is attributed to clinical uncertainty and habits of training. Research has focused on new techniques and more stringent evidence-based selection criteria to improve outcomes and produce consensus around treatment strategies for patients with ICH. Such focus, however, offers little description of how ICH treatment decisions are made and how such decisions reflect patient preferences regarding medical care. A growing body of literature suggests that the process of decision making in ICH is laden with bias, value assumptions, and subjective impressions. Factors such as geography, cognitive biases, patient perceptions, and physician characteristics can all shape decision making and the selection of treatment. Such factors often serve as a barrier to providing patient-centered medical care. In this article, the authors review how surgical decision making for patients with ICH is shaped by these decisional factors and suggest future research pathways to study decision making in ICH. Such research efforts are important for establishing quality guidelines and pay-for-performance measures that reflect the preferences of individual patients and the contextual nature of medical decision making.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To examine whether early intervention (CEA) was superior to initial medical therapy in real-world practice in preventing fatal and nonfatal strokes among patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This comparative effectiveness study was conducted from August 28, 2018, to March 2, 2020, using the Corporate Data Warehouse, Suicide Data Repository, and other databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs. Data analyzed were those of veterans of the US Armed Forces aged 65 years or older who received carotid imaging between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2009. Patients without a carotid imaging report, those with carotid stenosis of less than 50\% or hemodynamically insignificant stenosis, and those with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack in the 6 months before index imaging were excluded. A cohort of patients who received initial medical therapy and a cohort of similar patients who received CEA were constructed and followed up for 5 years. The target trial method was used to compute weighted Kaplan-Meier curves and estimate the risk of fatal and nonfatal strokes in each cohort in the pragmatic sample across 5 years of follow-up. This analysis was repeated after restricting the sample to patients who met RCT inclusion criteria. Cumulative incidence functions for fatal and nonfatal strokes were estimated, accounting for nonstroke deaths as competing risks in both the pragmatic and RCT-like samples. EXPOSURES Receipt of CEA vs initial medical therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Fatal and nonfatal strokes. RESULTS Of the total 5221 patients, 2712 (51.9\%; mean [SD] age, 73.6 [6.0] years; 2678 men [98.8\%]) received CEA and 2509 (48.1\%; mean [SD] age, 73.6 [6.0] years; 2479 men [98.8\%]) received initial medical therapy within 1 year after the index carotid imaging. The observed rate of stroke or death (perioperative complications) within 30 days in the CEA cohort was 2.5\% (95\% CI, 2.0\%-3.1\%). The 5-year risk of fatal and nonfatal strokes was lower among patients randomized to CEA compared with patients randomized to initial medical therapy (5.6\% vs 7.8\%; risk difference, -2.3\%; 95\% CI, -4.0\% to -0.3\%). In an analysis that incorporated the competing risk of death, the risk difference between the 2 cohorts was lower and not statistically significant (risk difference, -0.8\%; 95\% CI, -2.1\% to 0.5\%). Among patients who met RCT inclusion criteria, the 5-year risk of fatal and nonfatal strokes was 5.5\% (95\% CI, 4.5\%-6.5\%) among patients randomized to CEA and was 7.6\% (95\% CI, 5.7\%-9.5\%) among those randomized to initial medical therapy (risk difference, -2.1\%; 95\% CI, -4.4\% to -0.2\%). Accounting for competing risks resulted in a risk difference of -0.9\% (95\% CI, -2.9\% to 0.7\%) that was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study found that the absolute reduction in the risk of fatal and nonfatal strokes associated with early CEA was less than half the risk difference in trials from 20 years ago and was no longer statistically significant when the competing risk of nonstroke deaths was accounted for in the analysis. Given the nonnegligible perioperative 30-day risks and the improvements in stroke prevention, medical therapy may be an acceptable therapeutic strategy.

The aim of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial examining the effect of beta-blockers on outcomes in TBI patients. Methods Adult patients with severe TBI (intracranial AIS C 3) were included in the study. Hemodynamically stable patients at 24 h after injury were randomized to receive either 20 mg propranolol orally every 12 h up to 10 days or until discharge (BB?) or no propranolol (BB-). Outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) score on discharge and at 6-month follow-up. Subgroup analysis including only isolated severe TBI (intracranial AIS C 3 with extracranial AIS B 2) was carried out. Poisson regression models were used. Results Two hundred nineteen randomized patients of whom 45\% received BB were analyzed. There were no significant demographic or clinical differences between BB? and BB- cohorts. No significant difference in inhospital mortality (adj. IRR 0.6 [95\% CI 0.3\textendash 1.4], p = 0.2) or long-term functional outcome was measured between the cohorts (p = 0.3). One hundred fifty-four patients suffered isolated severe TBI of whom 44\% received BB. The BB? group had significantly lower mortality relative to the BB- group (18.6\% vs. 4.4\%, p = 0.012). On regression analysis, propranolol had a significant protective effect on in-hospital mortality (adj. IRR 0.32, p = 0.04) and functional outcome at 6-month follow-up (GOS-E C 5 adj. IRR 1.2, p = 0.02). Conclusion Propranolol decreases in-hospital mortality and improves long-term functional outcome in isolated severe TBI.

This study evaluated factors associated with admission to intensive care unit (ICU) level of care.

Factors associated with neuroscience ICU admission were identified via logistic regression analysis, from which a triage model was derived, refined, and retrospectively validated. For the derivation cohort, 229 patients were included, of whom 70 patients (31 \%) required ICU care. Predictors of neuroscience ICU admission were: younger age [odds ratio (OR) 0.94, 95 \% CI 0.91\textendash 0.97; p = 0.0004], lower Full Outline of UnResponsiveness (FOUR) score (0.39, 0.28\textendash 0.54; p {$<$} 0.0001) or Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (0.55, 0.45\textendash 0.67; p {$<$} 0.0001), and larger ICH volume (1.04, 1.03\textendash 1.06; p {$<$} 0.0001). The model was further refined with clinician input and the addition of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). GCS was chosen for the model rather than the FOUR score as it is more widely used. The proposed triage ICH model utilizes three variables: ICH volume {$\geq$}30 cc, GCS score {$<$}13, and IVH. The triage ICH model predicted the need for ICU admission with a sensitivity of 94.3 \% in the derivation cohort [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.88; p {$<$} 0.001] and 97.8 \% (AUC = 0.88) in the validation cohort. Presented are the derivation, refinement, and validation of the triage ICH model. This model requires prospective validation, but may be a useful tool to aid clinicians in determining the appropriate level of care at the time of initial presentation for a patient with a supratentorial ICH.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (4FPCCs) are emerging as the standard of care for emergent warfarin reversal due to their ability to rapidly and effectively achieve hemostasis. The ideal dose of this medication is not known. Recently, our hospital instituted a protocol where all doses of 4FPCC were a fixed dose of 1500 IU. This protocol provides 4FPCC rapidly and precludes delay waiting for international normalized ratio (INR) values. The purpose of this study was to evaluate our experience with this fixed dose protocol. Methods: This is a retrospective review of patients who received 1500 IU of 4FPCC for emergent warfarin reversal between March 2014 and January 2015. Demographic and clinical data regarding administration, efficacy, and safety were collected and analyzed. Results: A total of 39 patients met inclusion criteria. The most common indication for treatment was intracranial hemorrhage (28, 71.8\%). The median INR at presentation was 3.3, and the median INR after a single dose of 1500 IU was 1.4 (P b .001). A total of 36 patients (92.3\%) achieved successful reversal with a target INR of less than 2.0, and 28 patients (71.8\%) achieved successful reversal with a target INR of 1.5 or less. There were no thrombotic adverse events within 7 days. Conclusions: Administration of a fixed dose of 1500 IU of 4FPCC leads to high rates of successful INR reversal and no related thrombotic adverse events within 7 days, and there was no need to wait for INR at presentation. These findings suggest good efficacy and safety when using 1500 IU of 4FPCC for emergent warfarin reversal.},

  abstract = {Current guidelines for management of critically ill stroke patients suggest that treatment in a neurocritical care unit (NCCU) and/or by a neurointensivist (NI) may be beneficial, but the contribution of each to outcome is unknown. The relative impact of a NCCU versus NI on short- and long-term outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was assessed. 2,096 stroke patients admitted to a NCCU or nonneuro ICU at a tertiary stroke center were analyzed before the appointment of a NI, during the NI's tenure, and after the NI departed and was not replaced. Data included admission ICU type, availability of a NI, age, NIHSS, ICH score, and 3 and 12 month outcome. For AIS, compared to the time interval with a NI, departure of the NI predicted a worse rate of return to pre-stroke function at 3 months. For ICH, NCCU treatment predicted shorter ICU and hospital LOS but had no effect on short- or long-term outcomes. No effect of a NI was seen. For SAH, availability of an NI (but not an NCCU) predicted improved outcomes but longer ICU LOS. Disposition and in-hospital mortality improved when a NI was present, but continued improvement did not occur after the NI's departure. Presence of an NI was associated with improved clinical outcomes. This effect was more evident in patients with SAH. Patients with ICH tend to have poor outcomes regardless of the presence of a NCCU or a NI.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Acute occlusion of the major cerebral arteries results in ischaemic changes to the brain, without time for reperfusion by the collateral circulation. The subsequent cellular events lead to a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, causing malignant cerebral edema manifested clinically by a rapid neurological deterioration. The aim of this study was to determine the value of surgical decompression in patients who present with acute cerebral infarction. METHODS Retrospective review of patients with deteriorating consciousness level from massive cerebral ischemia and secondary edema, treated by decompressive craniectomy. RESULTS There were 10 patients over a 2-year period from 1997\textendash 99, consisting of seven male and three female patients (mean age 47.56 years) with a mean preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 6/15. Three patients had dominant middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction, four had nondominant MCA infarction, one had posterior cerebral artery infarction, and the remaining two had cerebellar infarction. At a mean follow-up period of 7 months, two patients had died (20\% mortality), four patients (40\%) were vegetative or severely disabled, and the remaining four patients (40\%) had mild disability or good outcome. Favorable prognostic factors were younger age (less than 50 years) and good initial GCS score (14 or better). CONCLUSION Decompressive craniectomy in the setting of acute brain swelling from cerebral infarction is a life-saving procedure and should be considered in younger patients who have a rapidly deteriorating neurologic status. \textcopyright{} 2000 by Elsevier Science Inc.},

From 2010 to 2018, VBO patients were selected from a university hospital registry. In total, 138 VBO patients were included. In these patients, a posterior circulation Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score (PC-ASPECTS) less than 6 was associated with futile outcome. Within patients with feasible cores, a decrease in PC-ASPECTS score of 2 or more on follow-up imaging was classified as infarct growth and could be predicted by a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) mental status subset of 1 or higher (odds ratio (OR): 3.34, 95\% confidence interval (CI) (1.19\textendash 9.38), p = 0.022). Among the 73 patients who did not undergo reperfusion therapy, 13 patients experienced ND (increase in discharge NIHSS score of 4 or more compared to the initial presentation). Incomplete occlusion (vs. complete occlusion, OR 6.17, 95\% CI (1.11\textendash 34.25), p = 0.037), poorer collateral status (BATMAN score, OR: 1.91, 95\% CI (1.17\textendash 3.48), p = 0.009), and larger infarct cores (PC-ASPECTS, OR: 1.96, 95\% CI (1.11\textendash 3.48), p = 0.021) were predictive of ND. In patients with VBO, an initial PC-ASPECTS of 6 or more, but with a decrease in the mental status subset of 1 or more can predict infarct growth, and may be used as a criterion for clinical-core mismatch. ND in VBO patients presenting with milder symptoms can be predicted by incomplete occlusion, poor collaterals, and larger infarct cores.},

Precision medicine is formalized as a treatment regime that comprises a sequence of decision rules, one per decision point, which map up-to-date patient information to a recommended action. The potential actions could be the selection of which drug to use, the selection of dose, the timing of administration, the recommendation of a specific diet or exercise, or other aspects of treatment or care.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study analyzed patients with TBI who were enrolled in the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems National Database, a prospective, multiyear, longitudinal database. Patients were survivors of moderate or severe TBI who were discharged from acute hospitalization and admitted to inpatient rehabilitation from January 4, 1989, to June 19, 2019, at 1 of 23 inpatient rehabilitation centers that participated in the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems program. Follow-up for the study was through completion of inpatient rehabilitation. EXPOSURES Traumatic brain injury. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcome measures were Glasgow Coma Scale in the emergency department, Disability Rating Scale, posttraumatic amnesia, and Functional Independence Measure. Patient-related data included demographic characteristics, injury cause, and brain computed tomography findings. RESULTS The 17 470 patients with TBI analyzed in this study had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age at injury of 39 (25-56) years and included 12 854 male individuals (74\%). Of these patients, 7547 (57\%) experienced initial loss of consciousness, which persisted to rehabilitation in 2058 patients (12\%). Those with persisting DOC were younger; had more high-velocity injuries; had intracranial mass effect, intraventricular hemorrhage, and subcortical contusion; and had longer acute care than patients without DOC. Eighty-two percent (n = 1674) of comatose patients recovered consciousness during inpatient rehabilitation. In a multivariable analysis, the factors associated with consciousness recovery were absence of intraventricular hemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.678; 95\% CI, 0.532-0.863; P = .002) and intracranial mass effect (adjusted OR, 0.759; 95\% CI, 0.595-0.968; P = .03). Functional improvement (change in total functional independence score from admission to discharge) was +43 for patients with DOC and +37 for those without DOC (P = .002), and 803 of 2013 patients with DOC (40\%) became partially or fully independent. Younger age, male sex, and absence of intraventricular hemorrhage, intracranial mass effect, and subcortical contusion were associated with better functional outcome. Findings were consistent across the 3 decades of the database. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study found that DOC occurred initially in most patients with TBI and persisted in some patients after rehabilitation, but most patients with persisting DOC recovered consciousness during rehabilitation. This recovery trajectory may inform acute and rehabilitation treatment decisions and suggests caution is warranted in consideration of withdrawing or withholding care in patients with TBI and DOC.},

It is not known to which extent spontaneous improvement, effect of placebo and effect of active interventions contribute to the observed change from baseline, and we aimed at quantifying these contributions. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis, based on a Cochrane review of the effect of placebo interventions for all clinical conditions. We selected all trials that had randomised the patients to three arms: no treatment, placebo and active intervention, and that had used an outcome that was measured on a continuous scale or on a ranking scale. Clinical conditions that had been studied in less than three trials were excluded. Results: We analysed 37 trials (2900 patients) that covered 8 clinical conditions. The active interventions were psychological in 17 trials, physical in 15 trials, and pharmacological in 5 trials. Overall, across all conditions and interventions, there was a statistically significant change from baseline in all three arms. The standardized mean difference (SMD) for change from baseline was 0.24 (95\% confidence interval -0.36 to -0.12) for no treatment, -0.44 (-0.61 to -0.28) for placebo, and -1.01 (-1.16 to -0.86) for active treatment. Thus, on average, the relative contributions of spontaneous improvement and of placebo to that of the active interventions were 24\% and 20\%, respectively, but with some uncertainty, as indicated by the confidence intervals for the three SMDs. The conditions that had the most pronounced spontaneous improvement were nausea (45\%), smoking (40\%), depression (35\%), phobia (34\%) and acute pain (25\%). Conclusion: Spontaneous improvement and effect of placebo contributed importantly to the observed treatment effect in actively treated patients, but the relative importance of these factors differed according to clinical condition and intervention.},

The study included 1279 consenting individuals (1049 White, 89 Black, 77 Hispanic, and 64 other race/ethnicity) of 1335 eligible patients presenting with primary ICH and who were discharged alive from initial hospitalization for stroke. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We conducted univariable and multivariable analyses for ICH recurrence risk and depression severity, including subset analyses for patients with 1 or more of the following characteristics associated with high ICH recurrence risk: (1) lobar ICH; (2) presence of the apolipoprotein {$\epsilon$}2/{$\epsilon$}4 gene variants; (3) prior history of ICH/TIA/ischemic stroke; and (4) Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity. RESULTS Mean age of study participants was 71.3 years, with 602 women (47\%); of the 1279 participants, 1049 were White, 89 were Black, 77 were Hispanic, and 64 were other race/ethnicity. SSRI exposure was associated with both ICH recurrence (subhazard ratio [SHR], 1.31; 95\% CI, 1.08-1.59) and resolution of post-ICH depression (SHR, 1.53; 95\% CI, 1.12 2.09). Among those individuals at high risk for recurrent ICH, SSRIs were associated with further elevation in risk for ICH recurrence (SHR, 1.79; 95\% CI, 1.22-2.64) compared with all other survivors of ICH (SHR, 1.20; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.42; P = .008 for comparison of effect sizes). The association of SSRI with reduced depressive symptoms did not differ between high those at high risk for recurrent ICH and all other ICH survivors. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor exposure after ICH is associated with both improvement in depressive symptoms and increased risk of recurrent hemorrhagic stroke. Clinical history, neuroimaging data, and genetic biomarkers may help to identify survivors of ICH more likely to safely tolerate SSRI use.},

After adjustment, surgical hematoma evacuation vs conservative treatment was not significantly associated with likelihood of better functional disability at 3 months (30.9\% vs 35.5\%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.94 [95\% CI, 0.81 to 1.09], P = .43; adjusted risk difference [ARD], -3.7\% [95\% CI, -8.7\% to 1.2\%]) but was significantly associated with greater probability of survival at 3 months (78.3\% vs 61.2\%; AOR, 1.25 [95\% CI, 1.07 to 1.45], P = .005; ARD, 18.5\% [95\% CI, 13.8\% to 23.2\%]) and at 12 months (71.7\% vs 57.2\%; AOR, 1.21 [95\% CI, 1.03 to 1.42], P = .02; ARD, 17.0\% [95\% CI, 11.5\% to 22.6\%]). A volume range of 12 to 15 cm3 was identified; below this level, surgical hematoma evacuation was associated with lower likelihood of favorable functional outcome (volume Յ12 cm3, 30.6\% vs 62.3\% [P = .003]; ARD, -34.7\% [-38.8\% to -30.6\%]; P value for interaction, .01), and above, it was associated with greater likelihood of survival (volume Ն15 cm3, 74.5\% vs 45.1\% [P {$<$} .001]; ARD, 28.2\% [95\% CI, 24.6\% to 31.8\%]; P value for interaction, .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with cerebellar ICH, surgical hematoma evacuation, compared with conservative treatment, was not associated with improved functional outcome. Given the null primary outcome, investigation is necessary to establish whether there are differing associations based on hematoma volume. JAMA. 2019;322(14):1392-1403. doi:10.1001/jama.2019.13014},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subcortical injury resulting from conventional surgical management of intracranial hemorrhage may counteract the potential benefits of hematoma evacuation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and potential benefits of a novel, minimally invasive approach for clot evacuation in a multicenter study. METHODS: The integrated approach incorporates 5 competencies: (1) image interpretation and trajectory planning, (2) dynamic navigation, (3) atraumatic access system (BrainPath, NICO Corp, Indianapolis, Indiana), (4) extracorporeal optics, and (5) automated atraumatic resection. Twelve neurosurgeons from 11 centers were trained to use this approach through a continuing medical education-accredited course. Demographical, clinical, and radiological data of patients treated over 2~years were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Thirty-nine consecutive patients were identified. The median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at presentation was 10 (range, 5-15). The thalamus/basal ganglion regions were involved in 46\% of the cases. The median hematoma volume and depth were 36~mL (interquartile range [IQR], 27-65~mL) and 1.4~cm (IQR, 0.3-2.9~cm), respectively. The median time from ictus to surgery was 24.5~hours (IQR, 16-66~hours). The degree of hematoma evacuation was {$\geq$}90\%, 75\% to 89\%, and 50\% to 74\% in 72\%, 23\%, and 5.0\% of the patients, respectively. The median GCS score at discharge was 14 (range, 8-15). The improvement in GCS score was statistically significant ( P {$<$} .001). Modified Rankin Scale data were available for 35 patients. Fifty-two percent of those patients had a modified Rankin Scale score of {$\leq$}2. There were no mortalities. CONCLUSION: The approach was safely performed in all patients with a relatively high rate of clot evacuation and functional independence.},

Methods:\hspace{0.6em} A 1-year (April 2015 and March 2016) cohort of all adult patients transported by EMS in the province of Alberta, Canada, was linked to hospital administrative databases. The main outcomes were infection, or sepsis diagnosis among patients with infection, in the Emergency Department. We estimated the probability of these outcomes, conditional on signs and symptoms that are commonly available to paramedics. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Among 131,745 patients transported by EMS, the prevalence of infection was 9.7\% and sepsis was 2.1\%. The in-hospital mortality rate for patients with sepsis was 28\%. The majority (62\%) of patients with infections were classified by one of three dispatch categories (``breathing problems,''``sick patient,'' or ``inter-facility transfer''), and the probability of infection diagnosis was 17\textendash 20\% for patients within these categories. Patients with elevated temperature measurements had the highest probability for infection diagnosis, but altered Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), low blood pressure, or abnormal respiratory rate had the highest probability for sepsis diagnosis. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} Dispatch categories and elevated temperature identify patients with higher probability of infection, but abnormal GCS, low blood pressure, and abnormal respiratory rate identify patients with infection who have a higher probability of sepsis. These characteristics may be considered by paramedics to identify higher-risk patients prior to arrival at the hospital.},

  abstract = {Background: Advance care planning (ACP) is recommended to align treatment with patient goals, although there has been little study of the impact of ACP on in-hospital stroke treatment. Objective: To examine the association between ACP and transitions to comfort measures after stroke. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting/Subjects: Hospitalized stroke patients 45 years and older and surrogate decision makers from a population-based study in Corpus Christi, TX. Measurements: Surrogates were interviewed to assess presence of patient prestroke ACP, categorized as none, informal conversations only, or formal documentation. Patient records were reviewed for time from admission to transition to comfort measures only (CMO) (defined as in-hospital comfort measures or discharge with hospice services). Cox proportional-hazards models assessed the relationship between ACP and time to transition to CMO. Results: Of 148 included stroke patients, 37\% transitioned to CMO (median time five days). For ACP, 44\% had only informal conversations, 38\% had formal documentation (98\% of which also reported informal conversations), and 18\% had neither. After adjustment for age, severity, and baseline disability, informal conversations alone (hazard ratio [HR] 3.55; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.35\textendash 9.33) and formal documentation (HR 2.85; 95\% CI: 1.05\textendash 7.72) were associated with earlier transition to comfort measures compared to no ACP. There was no difference between formal documentation and informal conversations on time to comfort measures (HR 0.80, 95\% CI: 0.40\textendash 1.63). Conclusions: There was no additional association of formal ACP documentation over informal conversations on time to transition to comfort measures after stroke. Further study of formal ACP is warranted.},

  abstract = {Background In patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), neuromuscular blocking agents may improve oxygenation and decrease ventilator-induced lung injury but may also cause muscle weakness. We evaluated clinical outcomes after 2 days of therapy with neuromuscular blocking agents in patients with early, severe ARDS. Methods In this multicenter, double-blind trial, 340 patients presenting to the intensive care unit (ICU) with an onset of severe ARDS within the previous 48 hours were randomly assigned to receive, for 48 hours, either cisatracurium besylate (178 patients) or placebo (162 patients). Severe ARDS was defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of less than 150, with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm or more of water and a tidal volume of 6 to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who died either before hospital discharge or within 90 days after study enrollment (i.e., the 90-day in-hospital mortality rate), adjusted for predefined covariates and baseline differences between groups with the use of a Cox model. Results The hazard ratio for death at 90 days in the cisatracurium group, as compared with the placebo group, was 0.68 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 0.98; P\,=\,0.04), after adjustment for both the baseline PaO2:FIO2 and plateau pressure and the Simplified Acute Physiology II score. The crude 90-day mortality was 31.6\% (95\% CI, 25.2 to 38.8) in the cisatracurium group and 40.7\% (95\% CI, 33.5 to 48.4) in the placebo group (P\,=\,0.08). Mortality at 28 days was 23.7\% (95\% CI, 18.1 to 30.5) with cisatracurium and 33.3\% (95\% CI, 26.5 to 40.9) with placebo (P\,=\,0.05). The rate of ICU-acquired paresis did not differ significantly between the two groups. Conclusions In patients with severe ARDS, early administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent improved the adjusted 90-day survival and increased the time off the ventilator without increasing muscle weakness.

Methods:\hspace{0.6em} In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, CINHAL, ACPJC, Google Scholar, and unpublished sources from inception until June 24, 2020 for randomized-controlled trials com-paring TXA and placebo in adults and adolescents ({$\geq$}\,15 years of age) with acute TBI. We screened studies and extracted summary estimates independently and in duplicate. We assessed the quality of evidence using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020164232). Results:\hspace{0.6em} Nine RCTs enrolled 14,747 patients. Compared to placebo, TXA had no effect on mortality (RR 0.95; 95\% CI 0.88\textendash 1.02; RD 1.0\% reduction; 95\% CI 2.5\% reduction to 0.4\% increase, moderate certainty) or disability assessed by the Disability Rating Scale (MD, - 0.18 points; 95\% CI - 0.43 to 0.08; moderate certainty). TXA may reduce hematoma expansion on subsequent imaging (RR 0.77; 95\% CI 0.58\textendash 1.03, RD 3.6\%, 95\% CI 6.6\% reduction to 0.5\% increase, low certainty). Risks of adverse events (all moderate, low, or very low certainty) were similar between placebo and TXA. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} In patients with acute TBI, TXA probably has no effect on mortality or disability. TXA may decrease hematoma expansion on subsequent imaging; however, this outcome is likely of less importance to patients. The use of TXA probably does not increase the risk of adverse events.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash Clinical trials in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) have used volume cutoffs as inclusion criteria to select populations in which the effects of interventions are likely to be the greatest. However, optimal volume cutoffs for predicting poor outcome in deep locations (thalamus versus basal ganglia) are unknown. Methods\textemdash We conducted a 2-phase study to determine ICH volume cutoffs for poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of 4\textendash 6) in the thalamus and basal ganglia. Cutoffs with optimal sensitivity and specificity for poor outcome were identified in the ERICH ([Ethnic/Racial Variations of ICH] study; derivation cohort) using receiver operating characteristic curves. The cutoffs were then validated in the ATACH-2 trial (Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage-2) by comparing the c-statistic of regression models for outcome (including dichotomized volume) in the validation cohort. Results\textemdash Of the 3000 patients enrolled in ERICH, 1564 (52\%) had deep ICH, of whom 1305 (84\%) had complete neuroimaging and outcome data (660 thalamic and 645 basal ganglia hemorrhages). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified 8 mL in thalamic (area under the curve, 0.79; sensitivity, 73\%; specificity, 78\%) and 18 mL in basal ganglia ICH (area under the curve, 0.79; sensitivity, 70\%; specificity, 83\%) as optimal cutoffs for predicting poor outcome. The validation cohort included 834 (84\%) patients with deep ICH and complete neuroimaging data enrolled in ATACH-2 (353 thalamic and 431 basal ganglia hemorrhages). In thalamic ICH, the c-statistic of the multivariable outcome model including dichotomized ICH volume was 0.80 (95\% CI, 0.75\textendash 0.85) in the validation cohort. For basal ganglia ICH, the c-statistic was 0.81 (95\% CI, 0.76\textendash 0.85) in the validation cohort. Conclusions\textemdash Optimal hematoma volume cutoffs for predicting poor outcome in deep ICH vary by the specific deep brain nucleus involved. Utilization of location-specific volume cutoffs may improve clinical trial design by targeting deep ICH patients that will obtain maximal benefit from candidate therapies.\hspace{0.6em}\,{$\mkern1mu$}(Stroke. 2019;50:2044-2049.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether fluvoxamine, given during mild COVID-19 illness, prevents clinical deterioration and decreases the severity of disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Double-blind, randomized, fully remote (contactless) clinical trial of fluvoxamine vs placebo. Participants were community-living, nonhospitalized adults with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, with COVID-19 symptom onset within 7 days and oxygen saturation of 92\% or greater. One hundred fifty-two participants were enrolled from the St Louis metropolitan area (Missouri and Illinois) from April 10, 2020, to August 5, 2020. The final date of follow-up was September 19, 2020. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg of fluvoxamine (n = 80) or placebo (n = 72) 3 times daily for 15 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was clinical deterioration within 15 days of randomization defined by meeting both criteria of (1) shortness of breath or hospitalization for shortness of breath or pneumonia and (2) oxygen saturation less than 92\% on room air or need for supplemental oxygen to achieve oxygen saturation of 92\% or greater. RESULTS Of 152 patients who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 46 [13] years; 109 [72\%] women), 115 (76\%) completed the trial. Clinical deterioration occurred in 0 of 80 patients in the fluvoxamine group and in 6 of 72 patients in the placebo group (absolute difference, 8.7\% [95\% CI, 1.8\%-16.4\%] from survival analysis; log-rank P = .009). The fluvoxamine group had 1 serious adverse event and 11 other adverse events, whereas the placebo group had 6 serious adverse events and 12 other adverse events. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this preliminary study of adult outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19, patients treated with fluvoxamine, compared with placebo, had a lower likelihood of clinical deterioration over 15 days. However, the study is limited by a small sample size and short follow-up duration, and determination of clinical efficacy would require larger randomized trials with more definitive outcome measures.},

The Society of Critical Care Medicine convened a taskforce of Academic Leaders in Critical Care Medicine on February 22, 2016, during the 45th Critical Care Congress to develop a toolkit drawing on the experience of successful leaders of critical care organizations in North America for advancing critical care organizations (Appendix 1). The goal of this article was to provide a roadmap and call attention to key factors that adult critical care medicine leadership in both academic and nonacademic setting should consider when planning for value-based care. Design: Relevant medical literature was accessed through a literature search. Material published by federal health agencies and other specialty organizations was also reviewed. Collaboratively and iteratively, taskforce members corresponded by electronic mail and held monthly conference calls to finalize this report. Setting: The business and value\&sol;performance critical care organization building section comprised of leaders of critical care organizations with expertise in critical care administration, healthcare management, and clinical practice. Measurements and Main Results: Two phases of critical care organizations care integration are described: ``horizontal,'' within the system and regionalization of care as an initial phase, and ``vertical,'' with a post-ICU and postacute care continuum as a succeeding phase. The tools required for the clinical and financial transformation are provided, including the essential prerequisites of forming a critical care organization; the manner in which a critical care organization can help manage transformational domains is considered. Lastly, how to achieve organizational health system support for critical care organization implementation is discussed. Conclusions: A critical care organization that incorporates functional clinical horizontal and vertical integration for ICU patients and survivors, aligns strategy and operations with those of the parent health system, and encompasses knowledge on finance and risk will be better positioned to succeed in the value-based world.}

We present novel evidence that analyzing ordinal data as if they were metric can systematically lead to errors. We demonstrate false alarms (i.e., detecting an effect where none exists, Type I errors) and failures to detect effects (i.e., loss of power, Type II errors). We demonstrate systematic inversions of effects, for which treating ordinal data as metric indicates the opposite ordering of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same problems \textemdash{} false alarms, misses, and inversions \textemdash{} for interactions in factorial designs and for trend analyses in regression. We demonstrate that averaging across multiple ordinal measurements does not solve or even ameliorate these problems. A central contribution is a graphical explanation of how and when the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that there is no sure-fire way to detect these problems by treating the ordinal values as metric, and instead we advocate use of ordered-probit models (or similar) because they will better describe the data. Finally, although frequentist approaches to some ordered-probit models are available, we use Bayesian methods because of their flexibility in specifying models and their richness and accuracy in providing parameter estimates. An R script is provided for running an analysis that compares ordered-probit and metric models.},

The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate long-term functional outcome in patients one year after SDC for space-occupying cerebellar infarction, and secondly, to determine factors associated with outcome. Patients and methods: All patients treated with SDC due to space-occupying cerebellar infarction between January 2009 and October 2015 were included in the study. Data was retrospectively collected from patient records, CT/MRI scans and surgical protocols. Long-term functional outcome was determined by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and mRS {$\geq$} 4 was defined as unfavorable outcome. Results: Twenty-two patients (16 male, 6 female) were included in the study. Median age was 53 years. Nine patients were treated with external ventricular drainage as an initial treatment attempt prior to SDC. Median time from symptom onset (stroke ictus) to initiation of the SDC surgery was 48 h (IQR 28\textendash 99 hours) and median GCS before SDC was 8 (IQR 5\textendash 10). At follow up, median mRS was 3 (IQR 2\textendash 6). Outcome was favorable (mRS 0\textendash 3) in 12 patients and unfavorable in 10 (3 with major disability, 7 dead). Brainstem infarction and bilateral cerebellar infarction were associated with unfavorable outcome. Conclusions: In this small study, functional long-term outcome in patients with space-occupying cerebellar infarction treated by SDC was acceptable and comparable to previously published results (favorable outcome in 54\% of patients). Brainstem infarction and bilateral cerebellar infarction were associated with unfavorable outcome.},

Aims: To study the impact of hospital case-volume on outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Methods: We included aSAH patients who underwent aneurysm coiling or clipping from tertiary care medical centers across three continents using the Dr Foster Stroke GOAL database 2007\textendash 2014. Hospitals were categorized by annual case-volume (low volume: {$<$}41/year; intermediate: 41\textendash 70/year; high: {$>$}70/year). Primary outcome was 14-day in-hospital case-fatality. We calculated proportions, and used multiple logistic regression to adjust for age, sex, differences in comorbidity or disease severity, aneurysm treatment modality, and hospital. Results: We included 8525 patients (2363 treated in low volume hospitals, 3563 treated in intermediate volume hospitals, and 2599 in high-volume hospitals). Crude 14-day case-fatality for hospitals with low case-volume was 10.4\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) 9.2\textendash 11.7\%), for intermediate volume 7.0\% (95\% CI 6.2\textendash 7.9\%; adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.63 (95\%CI 0.47\textendash 0.85)) and for high volume 5.4\% (95\% CI 4.6\textendash 6.3\%; adjusted OR 0.50 (95\% CI 0.33\textendash 0.74)). In patients with clipped aneurysms, adjusted OR for 14-day case-fatality was 0.46 (95\% CI 0.30\textendash 0.71) for hospitals with intermediate case-volume and 0.42 (95\% CI 0.25\textendash 0.72) with high case-volume. In patients with coiled aneurysms, adjusted OR was 0.77 (95\% CI 0.55\textendash 1.07) for hospitals with intermediate case-volume and 0.56 (95\% CI 0.36\textendash 0.87) with high case-volume. Conclusions: Even within a subset of large, tertiary care centers, intermediate and high hospital case-volume is associated with lower case-fatality after aSAH regardless of treatment modality, supporting centralization to higher volume centers.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To assess long-term population-based trends in the incidence of ICH, examine incidence rates stratified by deep and lobar locations, and characterize location-specific risk factors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This longitudinal prospective community-based cohort study comprised 10 333 original participants (n = 5209; age range, 28-62 years) and offspring participants (n = 5124; age range, 5-70 years) from the Framingham Heart Study who were followed up from January 1, 1948, to December 31, 2016. Original and offspring patient cohorts were confirmed to have experienced a spontaneous ICH event through imaging or pathologic testing. A total of 129 participants were identified with a primary incident of ICH. After exclusions, the remaining 99 patients were divided into 2 nested case-control samples, which were created by stratifying the first incident of ICH by brain region (lobar ICH or deep ICH), with 55 patients included in the lobar ICH sample and 44 patients included in the deep ICH sample. Patients were matched by age and sex (1:4 ratio) with 396 individuals without any stroke event (the control group). No participant in the patient samples was excluded or approached for consent, as their initial consent to participate in the Framingham Heart Study included consent to follow-up of cardiovascular outcomes. Data were analyzed in October 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The unadjusted and age-adjusted ICH incidence rates, assessed in 3 periods (period 1, from 1948-1986; period 2, from 1987-1999; and period 3, from 2000-2016) to study incidence trends. Nested case-control samples were used to examine baseline risk factors and medication exposures with the incidence of ICH events located in the lobar and deep brain regions within the 10 years before participants experienced a stroke event. RESULTS Of 10 333 original and offspring participants in the Framingham Heart Study, 129 patients (72 women [55.8\%]; mean [SD] age, 77 [11] years) experienced a primary ICH incident during a follow-up period of 68 years (301 282 person-years), with an incidence rate of 43 cases per 100 000 person-years. The unadjusted incidence rate increased over time, but the age-adjusted incidence rate decreased slightly between periods 2 and 3. An age-stratified analysis indicated a continued increase in ICH incidence among patients 75 years and older, reaching 176 cases per 100 000 person-years in period 3. A concurrent 3-fold increase in the use of anticoagulant medications was observed, from 4.4\% in period 2 to 13.9\% in period 3. The incidence rate increased substantially with age for both lobar and deep ICH. Higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure and statin medication use (odds ratio [OR], 4.07; 95\% CI, 1.16-14.21; P = .03) were associated with the incidence of deep ICH. Higher systolic blood pressure and apolipoprotein E {$\epsilon$}4 allele homozygosity (OR, 3.66; 95\% CI, 1.28-10.43; P = .02) were associated with the incidence of lobar ICH. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study found that the incidence of ICH increased in the oldest patients. Hypertension is a treatable risk factor for both deep and lobar ICH, while the use of statin medications is associated with the risk of a deep ICH event.},

Many techniques have been developed for study design and analysis to identify and eliminate such errors. Such problems are not expected to compromise experimental studies, where careful standardization of conditions (for laboratory work) and randomization (for population studies) should, if applied properly, eliminate most such noncausal associations. We argue, however, that a routine precaution taken in the design of biologic laboratory experiments\textemdash the use of ``negative controls''\textemdash is designed to detect both suspected and unsuspected sources of spurious causal inference. In epidemiology, analogous negative controls help to identify and resolve confounding as well as other sources of error, including recall bias or analytic flaws. We distinguish 2 types of negative controls (exposure controls and outcome controls), describe examples of each type from the epidemiologic literature, and identify the conditions for the use of such negative controls to detect confounding. We conclude that negative controls should be more commonly employed in observational studies, and that additional work is needed to specify the conditions under which negative controls will be sensitive detectors of other sources of error in observational studies.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Effect estimates from randomized trials and observational studies might not be directly comparable because of differences in study design, other than randomization, and in data analysis. We propose a 3-step procedure to facilitate meaningful comparisons of effect estimates from randomized trials and observational studies: 1) harmonization of the study protocols (eligibility criteria, treatment strategies, outcome, start and end of follow-up, causal contrast) so that the studies target the same causal effect, 2) harmonization of the data analysis to estimate the causal effect, and 3) sensitivity analyses to investigate the impact of discrepancies that could not be accounted for in the harmonization process. To illustrate our approach, we compared estimates of the effect of immediate with deferred initiation of antiretroviral therapy in individuals positive for the human immunodeficiency virus from the Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Therapy (START) randomized trial and the observational HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration.},

  abstract = {Objective\hspace{0.6em} The concept of the `self-\-fulfilling prophecy' is well established in intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). The ability to improve prognostication and prediction of long-\-term outcomes during the first days of hospitalisation is important in guiding conversations around goals of care. We previously demonstrated that incorporating delayed imaging into various prognostication scores for ICH improves the predictive accuracy of 90-\-day mortality. However, delayed prognostication scores have not been used to predict long-\-term functional outcomes beyond 90 days. Design, setting and participants\hspace{0.6em} We analysed data from the ICH Deferoxamine trial to see if delaying the use of prognostication scores to 96 hours after ICH onset will improve performance to predict outcomes at 180 days. 276 patients were included. Interventions and measurements\hspace{0.6em} We calculated the original ICH score (oICH), modified-\-ICH score (MICH), max-\- ICH score and the FUNC score on presentation (baseline), and on day 4 (delayed). Outcomes assessed were mortality and poor functional outcome in survivors (defined as modified Rankin Scale of 4\textendash 5) at 180 days. We generated receiver operating characteristic curves, and measured the area under the curve values (AUC) for mortality and functional outcome. We compared baseline and delayed AUCs with non-\-parametric methods. Results\hspace{0.6em} At 180 days, 21 of 276 (7.6\%) died. Out of the survivors, 54 of 255 had poor functional outcome (21.2\%). The oICH, MICH and max-\-ICH performed significantly better at predicting 180-\-day mortality when calculated 4\,days later compared with their baseline equivalents ((0.74 vs 0.83, p=0.005), (0.73 vs 0.80,\,p=0.036), (0.74 vs 0.83, p=0.008), respectively). The delayed calculation of these scores did not significantly improve our accuracy for predicting poor functional outcomes. Conclusion\hspace{0.6em} Delaying the calculation of prognostication scores in acute ICH until day 4 improved prediction of 6-\-month mortality but not functional outcomes.

Methods\textemdash Patients (nϭ413) were randomized to placebo or clazosentan beginning within 56 hours and continued up to 14 days after initiation of treatment. The primary end point was moderate or severe angiographic vasospasm based on centrally read, blinded evaluation of digital subtraction angiography at baseline and 7 to 11 days postsubarachnoid hemorrhage. A morbidity/mortality end point, including all-cause mortality, new cerebral infarct from any cause, delayed ischemic neurological deficit due to vasospasm, or use of rescue therapy, was evaluated by local assessment. Clinical outcome was assessed by the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale at 12 weeks. Results\textemdash Moderate or severe vasospasm was reduced in a dose-dependent fashion from 66\% in the placebo group to 23\% in the 15 mg/h clazosentan group (risk reduction, 65\%; 95\% CI, 47\% to 78\%; PϽ0.0001). No significant effects were seen on secondary end points. Post hoc analysis using a centrally assessed morbidity/mortality end point that included death and rescue therapy but only cerebral infarcts and delayed ischemic neurological deficit due to vasospasm on central review showed a trend toward improvement with clazosentan (37\%, 28\%, and 29\% in the 1, 5, and 15 mg/h groups versus 39\% in the placebo group, nonsignificant). Clazosentan was associated with increased rates of pulmonary complications, hypotension, and anemia. Conclusions\textemdash Clazosentan significantly decreased moderate and severe vasospasm in a dose-dependent manner and showed a trend for reduction in vasospasm-related morbidity/mortality in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage when centrally assessed. Overall, the adverse effects were manageable and not considered serious. (Stroke. 2008;39:3015-3021.)},

Secondary effects of SAH include increased intracranial pressure, destruction of brain tissue by intracerebral haemorrhage, brain shift, and herniation, all of which contribute to pathology. Many patients survive these phenomena, but deteriorate days later from delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI), which causes poor outcome or death in up to 30\% of patients with SAH. DCI is thought to be caused by the combined effects of angiographic vasospasm, arteriolar constriction and thrombosis, cortical spreading ischaemia, and processes triggered by EBI. Treatment for DCI includes prophylactic administration of nimodipine, and current neurointensive care. Prompt recognition of DCI and immediate treatment by means of induced hypertension and balloon or pharmacological angioplasty are considered important by many physicians, although the evidence to support such approaches is limited. This Review summarizes the pathophysiology of DCI after SAH and discusses established treatments for this condition. Novel strategies\textemdash including drugs such as statins, sodium nitrite, albumin, dantrolene, cilostazol, and intracranial delivery of nimodipine or magnesium\textemdash are also discussed.},

They may be regarded as either single state or transition measures based on whether they assess the outcome at a single point in time or directly examine change which has occurred between two points in time. Each has unique structural and operating characteristics, so that different methodological standards for their construction and utilisation are required. All trials employing ordinal scales published in three leading journals between 1980 and 1984 were examined. For both types of scales the individual ranks must be clearly defined, mutually exclusive, and ordered in a hierarchical progression. Further, both types must be able to detect equally both improvement and deterioration. For this to be ensured with the single state scales the population under study must not be clustered at one extreme of the scale at entry into the trial. With the transition scales internal symmetry must be achieved. Strategies for determining the comparisons to be performed should include emphasis on within patient analysis for crossover trials. Concordance between scale scores and the other measures of outcome employed in the trial must be evaluated.},

We determined the frequency of early DNR orders in ICH patients and whether a previously reported association with increased mortality still exists. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We performed a retrospective analysis of patients discharged from non-federal California hospitals with a primary diagnosis of ICH from January 2013 through December 2014. Characteristics included hospital ICH volume and type and whether DNR order was placed within 24 h of admission (early DNR order). The risk of in-hospital mortality was evaluated both on the individual and hospital level using multivariable analyses. A case mix-adjusted hospital DNR index was calculated for each hospital by comparing the actual number of DNR cases with the expected number of DNR cases from a multivariate model. Results:\hspace{0.6em} A total of 9,958 patients were treated in 180 hospitals. Early DNR orders were placed in 20.1\% of patients and 54.2\% of these patients died during their hospitalization compared to 16.0\% of patients without an early DNR order. For every 10\% increase in a hospital's utilization of early DNR orders, there was a corresponding 26\% increase in the likelihood of in-hospital mortality. Patients treated in hospitals within the highest quartile of adjusted DNR use had a higher relative risk of death compared to the lowest quartile (RR 3.9 vs 5.2) though the trend across quartiles was not statistically significant. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} The use of early DNR orders for ICH continues to be a strong predictor of in-hospital mortality. However, patients treated at hospitals with an overall high or low use of early DNR had similar relative risks of death whether or not there was an early DNR order, suggesting that such orders may not be a proxy for less aggressive care as seen previously.},

  abstract = {Volume infusions are one of the commonest clinical interventions in critically ill patients yet the relationship of volume to cardiac output is not well understood. Blood volume has a stressed and unstressed component but only the stressed component determines flow. It is usually about 30 \% of total volume. Stressed volume is relatively constant under steady state conditions. It creates an elastic recoil pressure that is an important factor in the generation of blood flow. The heart creates circulatory flow by lowering the right atrial pressure and allowing the recoil pressure in veins and venules to drain blood back to the heart. The heart then puts the volume back into the systemic circulation so that stroke return equals stroke volume. The heart cannot pump out more volume than comes back. Changes in cardiac output without changes in stressed volume occur because of changes in arterial and venous resistances which redistribute blood volume and change pressure gradients throughout the vasculature. Stressed volume also can be increased by decreasing vascular capacitance, which means recruiting unstressed volume into stressed volume. This is the equivalent of an auto-transfusion. It is worth noting that during exercise in normal young males, cardiac output can increase five-fold with only small changes in stressed blood volume. The mechanical characteristics of the cardiac chambers and the circulation thus ultimately determine the relationship between volume and cardiac output and are the subject of this review.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE               The objective of this study was to determine patterns of care and outcomes in ruptured intracranial aneurysms (IAs) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in a contemporary national cohort.                                         METHODS               The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of prospective data from a nationwide multicenter registry of all aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) cases admitted to a tertiary care neurosurgical department in Switzerland in the years 2009\textendash 2015 (Swiss Study on Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage [Swiss SOS]). Patterns of care and outcomes at discharge and the 1-year follow-up in MCA aneurysm (MCAA) patients were analyzed and compared with those in a control group of patients with IAs in locations other than the MCA (non-MCAA patients). Independent predictors of a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score {$\leq$} 3) were identified, and their effect size was determined.                                         RESULTS               Among 1866 consecutive aSAH patients, 413 (22.1\%) harbored an MCAA. These MCAA patients presented with higher World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grades (p = 0.007), showed a higher rate of concomitant intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH; 41.9\% vs 16.7\%, p {$<$} 0.001), and experienced delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) more frequently (38.9\% vs 29.4\%, p = 0.001) than non-MCAA patients. After adjustment for confounders, patients with MCAA were as likely as non-MCAA patients to experience DCI (aOR 1.04, 95\% CI 0.74\textendash 1.45, p = 0.830). Surgical treatment was the dominant treatment modality in MCAA patients and at a significantly higher rate than in non-MCAA patients (81.7\% vs 36.7\%, p {$<$} 0.001). An MCAA location was a strong independent predictor of surgical treatment (aOR 8.49, 95\% CI 5.89\textendash 12.25, p {$<$} 0.001), despite statistical adjustment for variables traditionally associated with surgical treatment, such as (space-occupying) ICH (aOR 1.73, 95\% CI 1.23\textendash 2.45, p = 0.002). Even though MCAA patients were less likely to die during the acute hospitalization (aOR 0.52, 0.30\textendash 0.91, p = 0.022), their rate of a favorable outcome was lower at discharge than that in non-MCAA patients (55.7\% vs 63.7\%, p = 0.003). At the 1-year follow-up, 68.5\% and 69.6\% of MCAA and non-MCAA patients, respectively, had a favorable outcome (p = 0.676).                                         CONCLUSIONS               Microsurgical occlusion remains the predominant treatment choice for about 80\% of ruptured MCAAs in a European industrialized country. Although patients with MCAAs presented with worse admission grades and greater rates of concomitant ICH, in-hospital mortality was lower and long-term disability was comparable to those in patients with non-MCAA.},

The surviving sepsis campaign (SSC) guidelines provide a strong recommendation to rapidly administer a minimum of 30 mL/kg crystalloid solution intravenously in all patients with septic shock and those with elevated blood lactate levels. However, there is no credible evidence to support this recommendation. In fact, recent findings from experimental, observational and randomized clinical trials demonstrate improved outcomes with a more restrictive approach to fluid resuscitation. Accumulating evidence suggests that aggressive fluid resuscitation is harmful. Paradoxically, excess fluid administration may worsen shock. In this review, we critically evaluate the scientific evidence for a weight-based fluid resuscitation approach. Furthermore, the potential mechanisms and consequences of harm associated with fluid resuscitation are discussed. Finally, we recommend an individualized, conservative and physiologic guided approach to fluid resuscitation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Among patients with stable coronary disease and moderate or severe ischemia, whether clinical outcomes are better in those who receive an invasive intervention plus medical therapy than in those who receive medical therapy alone is uncertain. METHODS We randomly assigned 5179 patients with moderate or severe ischemia to an initial invasive strategy (angiography and revascularization when feasible) and medical therapy or to an initial conservative strategy of medical therapy alone and angiography if medical therapy failed. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest. A key secondary outcome was death from cardiovascular causes or myocardial infarction. RESULTS Over a median of 3.2 years, 318 primary outcome events occurred in the invasivestrategy group and 352 occurred in the conservative-strategy group. At 6 months, the cumulative event rate was 5.3\% in the invasive-strategy group and 3.4\% in the conservative-strategy group (difference, 1.9 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.8 to 3.0); at 5 years, the cumulative event rate was 16.4\% and 18.2\%, respectively (difference, -1.8 percentage points; 95\% CI, -4.7 to 1.0). Results were similar with respect to the key secondary outcome. The incidence of the primary outcome was sensitive to the definition of myocardial infarction; a secondary analysis yielded more procedural myocardial infarctions of uncertain clinical importance. There were 145 deaths in the invasive-strategy group and 144 deaths in the conservative-strategy group (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95\% CI, 0.83 to 1.32).

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash Vasospasm is an important complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage, but is variably defined in the literature. Methods\textemdash We studied 580 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and identified those with: (1) symptomatic vasospasm, defined as clinical deterioration deemed secondary to vasospasm after other causes were eliminated; (2) delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), defined as symptomatic vasospasm, or infarction on CT attributable to vasospasm; (3) angiographic spasm, as seen on digital subtraction angiography; and (4) transcranial Doppler (TCD) spasm, defined as any mean flow velocity Ͼ120 cm/sec. Logistic regression analysis was performed to test the association of each definition of vasospasm with various hospital complications, and 3-month quality of life (sickness impact profile), cognitive status (telephone interview of cognitive status), instrumental activities of daily living (Lawton score), and death or severe disability at 3 months (modified Rankin scale score 4 \textendash{} 6), after adjustment for covariates. Results\textemdash Symptomatic vasospasm occurred in 16\%, DCI in 21\%, angiographic vasospasm in 31\%, and TCD spasm in 45\% of patients. DCI was statistically associated with more hospital complications (Nϭ7; all PϽ0.05) than symptomatic spasm (Nϭ4), angiographic spasm (Nϭ1), or TCD vasospasm (Nϭ1). Angiographic and TCD vasospasm were not related to any aspect of clinical outcome. Both symptomatic vasospasm and DCI were related to reduced instrumental activities of daily living, cognitive impairment, and poor quality of life (all PϽ0.05). However, only DCI was associated with death or severe disability at 3 months (adjusted OR, 2.2; 95\% CI, 1.2\textendash 3.9; Pϭ0.007). Conclusions\textemdash DCI is a more clinically meaningful definition than either symptomatic deterioration alone or the presence of arterial spasm by angiography or TCD.

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash We sought to evaluate the impact of a Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA) for All emergency stroke imaging protocol on outcome after large vessel occlusion (LVO).Methods\textemdash On July 1, 2017, the Henry Ford Health System implemented the policy of performing CTA and noncontrast computed tomography together as an initial imaging study for all patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) presenting within 24 hours of last known well, regardless of baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score. Previously, CTA was reserved for patients presenting within 6 hours with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score {$\geq$}6. We compared treatment processes and outcomes between patients with AIS admitted 1 year before (n=388) and after (n=515) protocol implementation.Results\textemdash After protocol implementation, more AIS patients underwent CTA (91\% versus 61\%; P{$<$}0.001) and had CTA performed at the same time as the initial noncontrast computed tomography scan (78\% versus 35\%; P{$<$}0.001). Median time from emergency department arrival to CTA was also shorter (29 [interquartile range, 16\textendash 53] versus 43 [interquartile range, 29\textendash 112] minutes; P{$<$}0.001), more cases of LVO were detected (166 versus 96; 32\% versus 25\% of all AIS; P=0.014), and more mechanical thrombectomy procedures were performed (108 versus 68; 21\% versus 18\% of all AIS; P=0.196). Among LVO patients who presented within 6 hours of last known well, median time from last known well to mechanical thrombectomy was shorter (3.5 [interquartile range, 2.8\textendash 4.8] versus 4.1 [interquartile range, 3.3\textendash 5.6] hours; P=0.038), and more patients were discharged with a favorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale 4\textendash 5, 53\% versus 37\%; P=0.029). The odds of having a favorable outcome after protocol implementation was not significant (odds ratio, 1.84 [95\% CI, 0.98\textendash 3.45]; P=0.059) after controlling for age and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score.Conclusions\textemdash Performing CTA and noncontrast computed tomography together as an initial assessment for all AIS patients presenting within 24 hours of last known well improved LVO detection, increased the mechanical thrombectomy treatment population, hastened intervention, and was associated with a trend toward improved outcome among LVO patients presenting within 6 hours of symptom onset.},

  abstract = {I critically analyze three groups of arguments for rejecting statistical significance tests (don't say `significance', don't use P-value thresholds), as espoused in the 2019 Editorial of The American Statistician (Wasserstein, Schirm and Lazar 2019). The strongest argument supposes that banning P-value thresholds would diminish P-hacking and data dredging. I argue that it is the opposite. In a world without thresholds, it would be harder to hold accountable those who fail to meet a predesignated threshold by dint of data dredging. Forgoing predesignated thresholds obstructs error control. If an account cannot say about any outcomes that they will not count as evidence for a claim\textemdash if all thresholds are abandoned\textemdash then there is no a test of that claim. Giving up on tests means forgoing statistical falsification. The second group of arguments constitutes a series of strawperson fallacies in which statistical significance tests are too readily identified with classic abuses of tests. The logical principle of charity is violated. The third group rests on implicit arguments. The first in this group presupposes, without argument, a different philosophy of statistics from the one underlying statistical significance tests; the second group\textemdash appeals to popularity and fear\textemdash only exacerbate the `perverse' incentives underlying today's replication crisis.},

We examined the association between dedicated neurocritical care units and mortality and the effects of standardized management protocols for severe traumatic brain injury. Design: We surveyed trauma medical directors from centers participating in the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program to obtain information about ICU structure and processes of care. Survey data were then linked to the Trauma Quality Improvement Program registry, and random-intercept hierarchical multivariable modeling was used to evaluate the association between dedicated neurocritical care units, the presence of standardized management protocols and mortality. Setting: Trauma centers in North America participating in Trauma Quality Improvement Program. Patients: Data were analyzed from 9,773 adult patients with isolated severe traumatic brain injury admitted to 134 Trauma Quality Improvement Program centers between 2011 and 2013. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Only 50 ICUs (37\&percnt;) were dedicated neurocritical care units, whereas 84 (63\&percnt;) were general ICUs. Rates of standardized management protocols were similar comparing dedicated neurocritical care units and general ICUs. Among severe TBI patients admitted to trauma centers enrolled in Trauma Quality Improvement Program, care in a dedicated neurocritical care unit did not improve risk-adjusted in-hospital survival (odds ratio, 0.97; 95\&percnt; CI, 0.80\textendash 1.19; p = 0.79). However, the presence of a standardized management protocol for these patients was associated with lower risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.77; 95\&percnt; CI, 0.63\textendash 0.93; p = 0.009). Conclusions: Compared with dedicated neurocritical care models, standardized management protocols for severe traumatic brain injured patients are process-targeted intervention strategies that may improve clinical outcomes.}

CSCs have been shown to improve clinical outcomes and mitigate disparities in ischemic stroke patients. It is believed that CSCs also improve outcomes in hemorrhagic stroke. We used the Myocardial Infarction Data Acquisition System (MIDAS) database, which includes data on patients discharged with a primary diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH; International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] 431) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH; ICD-9 430) from all nonfederal acute care hospitals in New Jersey (NJ) between 1996 and 2012. Out-of-hospital deaths were assessed by matching MIDAS records with NJ death registration files. The primary outcome variable was 90-day all-cause mortality. The primary independent variable was CSC versus primary stroke center (PSC) and nonstroke center (NSC) admission. Multivariate logistic models were used to measure the effects of available covariates. Overall, 36 981 patients were admitted with a primary diagnosis of ICH or SAH during the study period, of which 40\% were admitted to a CSC. Patients admitted to CSCs were more likely to have neurosurgical or endovascular interventions than those admitted to a PSC/NSC (18.9\% vs. 4.7\%; P{$<$}0.0001). CSC admission was associated with lower adjusted 90-day mortality (35.0\% vs. 40.3\%; odds ratio, 0.93; 95\% confidence interval, 0.89 to 0.97) for hemorrhagic stroke. This was particularly true for those admitted with SAH. Hemorrhagic stroke patients admitted to CSCs are more likely to receive neurosurgical and endovascular treatments and be alive at 90 days than patients admitted to other hospitals.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Health care providers who participate as an accountable care organization (ACO) in the voluntary Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) have incentives to lower spending for Medicare patients while achieving high performance on a set of quality measures. Little is known about the extent to which early savings achieved by ACOs in the program have grown and been replicated by ACOs that entered the program in later years. ACOs that are physician groups have stronger incentives to lower spending than hospital-integrated ACOs. METHODS Using fee-for-service Medicare claims from 2009 through 2015, we performed difference-in-differences analyses to compare changes in Medicare spending for patients in ACOs before and after entry into the MSSP with concurrent changes in spending for local patients served by providers not participating in the MSSP (control group). We estimated differential changes (i.e., the between-group difference in the change from the pre-entry period) separately for hospital-integrated ACOs and physiciangroup ACOs that entered the MSSP in 2012, 2013, or 2014. RESULTS MSSP participation was associated with differential spending reductions in physician-group ACOs. These reductions grew with longer participation in the program and were significantly greater than the reductions in hospital-integrated ACOs. By 2015, the mean differential change in per-patient Medicare spending was -\$474 (-4.9\% of the pre-entry mean, P{$<$}0.001) for physician-group ACOs that entered in 2012, -\$342 (-3.5\% of the pre-entry mean, P{$<$}0.001) for those that entered in 2013, and -\$156 (-1.6\% of the pre-entry mean, P\,=\,0.009) for those that entered in 2014. The corresponding differential changes for hospital-integrated ACOs were -\$169 (P\,=\,0.005), -\$18 (P\,=\,0.78), and \$88 (P\,=\,0.14), which were significantly lower than for physician-group ACOs (P{$<$}0.001). Spending reductions in physician-group ACOs constituted a net savings to Medicare of \$256.4 million in 2015, whereas spending reductions in hospital-integrated ACOs were offset by bonus payments.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Prior work has shown substantial between-hospital variation in do-not-resuscitate orders, but stability of do-not-resuscitate preferences between hospitalizations and the institutional influence on donot-resuscitate reversals are unclear. We determined the extent of do-notresuscitate reversals between hospitalizations and the association of the readmission hospital with do-not-resuscitate reversal. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: California Patient Discharge Database, 2016\textendash 2018. PATIENTS: Nonsurgical patients admitted to an acute care hospital with an early do-not-resuscitate order (within 24\,hr of admission). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified nonsurgical adult patients who survived an initial hospitalization with an early-do-notresuscitate order and were readmitted within 30 days. The primary outcome was the association of do-not-resuscitate reversal with readmission to the same or different hospital from the initial hospital. Secondary outcomes included association of readmission to a low versus high do-notresuscitate-rate hospital with do-not-resuscitate reversal. Among 49,336 patients readmitted within 30 days following a first do-not-resuscitate hospitalization, 22,251 (45.1\%) experienced do-not-resuscitate reversal upon readmission. Patients readmitted to a different hospital versus the same hospital were at higher risk of do-not-resuscitate reversal (59.5\% vs 38.5\%; p {$<$} 0.001; adjusted odds ratio = 2.4; 95\% CI, 2.3\textendash 2.5). Patients readmitted to low versus high do-not-resuscitate-rate hospitals were more likely to have do-not-resuscitate reversals (do-not-resuscitate-rate quartile 1 77.0\% vs quartile 4 27.2\%; p {$<$} 0.001; adjusted odds ratio = 11.9; 95\% CI, 10.7\textendash 13.2). When readmitted to a different versus the same hospital, patients with do-not-resuscitate reversal had higher rates of mechanical ventilation (adjusted odds ratio = 1.9; 95\% CI, 1.6\textendash 2.1) and hospital death (adjusted odds ratio = 1.2; 95\% CI, 1.1\textendash 1.3). CONCLUSIONS: Do-not-resuscitate reversals at the time of readmission are more common than previously reported. Although changes in patient preferences may partially explain between-hospital differences, we observed a strong hospital effect contributing to high do-not-resuscitate-reversal rates with significant implications for patient outcomes and resource.},

As such, the mFS is included as a common data element by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke SAH Working Group. There are few studies assessing the interrater reliability of the mFS. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We distributed a survey to a convenience sample with snowball sampling of practicing neurointensivists and through the research survey portion of the Neurocritical Care Society Web site. The survey consisted of 15 scrollable CT scans of patients with SAH for mFS grading, two questions regarding the definitions of the scale criteria and demographics of the responding physician. Kendall's coefficient of concordance was used to determine the interrater reliability of mFS grading. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Forty-six participants (97.8\% neurocritical care fellowship trained, 78\% UCNS-certified in neurocritical care, median 5 years (IQR 3\textendash 6.3) in practice, treating median of 80 patients (IQR 50\textendash 100) with SAH annually from 32 institutions) completed the survey. By mFS criteria, 30\% correctly identified that there is no clear measurement of thin versus thick blood, and 42\% correctly identified that blood in any ventricle is scored as ``intraventricular blood.''The overall interrater reliability by Kendall's coefficient of concordance for the mFS was moderate (W\,=\,0.586, p\,{$<$}\,0.0005). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Agreement among raters in grading the mFS is only moderate. Online training tools could be developed to improve mFS reliability and standardize research in SAH.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage accounts for 20\% of all stroke-related sudden neurological deficits, has the highest morbidity and mortality of all stroke, and the role of surgery remains controversial. We undertook a prospective randomised trial to compare early surgery with initial conservative treatment for patients with intracerebral haemorrhage. METHODS: A parallel-group trial design was used. Early surgery combined haematoma evacuation (within 24 h of randomisation) with medical treatment. Initial conservative treatment used medical treatment, although later evacuation was allowed if necessary. We used the eight-point Glasgow outcome scale obtained by postal questionnaires sent directly to patients at 6 months follow-up as the primary outcome measure. We divided the patients into good and poor prognosis groups on the basis of their clinical status at randomisation. For the good prognosis group, a favourable outcome was defined as good recovery or moderate disability on the Glasgow outcome scale. For the poor prognosis group, a favourable outcome also included the upper level of severe disability. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: 1033 patients from 83 centres in 27 countries were randomised to early surgery (503) or initial conservative treatment (530). At 6 months, 51 patients were lost to follow-up, and 17 were alive with unknown status. Of 468 patients randomised to early surgery, 122 (26\%) had a favourable outcome compared with 118 (24\%) of 496 randomised to initial conservative treatment (odds ratio 0.89 [95\% CI 0.66-1.19], p=0.414); absolute benefit 2.3\% (-3.2 to 7.7), relative benefit 10\% (-13 to 33). INTERPRETATION: Patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage in neurosurgical units show no overall benefit from early surgery when compared with initial conservative treatment.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To provide more in-depth insight in the development of early ICU-acquired hypernatremia in critically ill patients based on detailed, longitudinal and quantitative data. Materials and methods: A comparative analysis was performed using prospectively collected data of ICU patients. All patients requiring ICU admission for more than 48 h between April and December 2018 were included. For this study, urine samples were collected daily and analyzed for electrolytes and osmolality. Additionally, plasma osmolality analyses were performed. Further data collection consisted of routine laboratory results, detailed fluid balances and medication use. Results: A total of 183 patient were included for analysis, of whom 38\% developed ICU-acquired hypernatremia. Whereas the hypernatremic group was similar to the non-hypernatremic group at baseline and during the first days, hypernatremic patients had a significantly higher sodium intake on day 2 to 5, a lower urine sodium concentration on day 3 and 4 and a worse kidney function (plasma creatinine 251 versus 71.9 {$\mu$}mol/L on day 5). Additionally, hypernatremic patients had higher APACHE IV scores (67 versus 49, p {$<$} 0.05) and higher ICU (23 versus 12\%, p = 0.07) and 90-day mortality (33 versus 14\%, p {$<$} 0.01). Conclusions: Longitudinal analysis shows that the development of early ICU-acquired hypernatremia is preceded by increased sodium intake, decreased renal function and decreased sodium excretion. \textcopyright{} 2021 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Background Cardiac arrest with widespread cerebral ischemia frequently leads to severe neurologic impairment. We studied whether mild systemic hypothermia increases the rate of neurologic recovery after resuscitation from cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation. Methods In this multicenter trial with blinded assessment of the outcome, patients who had been resuscitated after cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation were randomly assigned to undergo therapeutic hypothermia (target temperature, 32\textdegree C to 34\textdegree C, measured in the bladder) over a period of 24 hours or to receive standard treatment with normothermia. The primary end point was a favorable neurologic outcome within six months after cardiac arrest; secondary end points were mortality within six months and the rate of complications within seven days. Results Seventy-five of the 136 patients in the hypothermia group for whom data were available (55 percent) had a favorable neurologic outcome (cerebralperformance category, 1 [good recovery] or 2 [moderate disability]), as compared with 54 of 137 (39 percent) in the normothermia group (risk ratio, 1.40; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.81). Mortality at six months was 41 percent in the hypothermia group (56 of 137 patients died), as compared with 55 percent in the normothermia group (76 of 138 patients; risk ratio, 0.74; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.58 to 0.95). The complication rate did not differ significantly between the two groups. Conclusions In patients who have been successfully resuscitated after cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, therapeutic mild hypothermia increased the rate of a favorable neurologic outcome and reduced mortality.

METHODS We conducted interrupted time-series analyses of electronic medical record (EMR) data from 2010 to 2017 for 12 quality-of-care indicators in the United Kingdom's Quality and Outcomes Framework for which financial incentives were removed in 2014 and 6 indicators for which incentives were maintained. We estimated the effects of removing incentives on changes in performance on quality-of-care measures. N Engl J Med 2018;379:948-57. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMsa1801495 Copyright \textcopyright{} 2018 Massachusetts Medical Society. RESULTS Complete longitudinal data were available for 2819 English primary care practices with more than 20 million registered patients. There were immediate reductions in documented quality of care for all 12 indicators in the first year after the removal of financial incentives. Reductions were greatest for indicators related to health advice, with a reduction of 62.3 percentage points (95\% confidence interval [CI], -65.6 to -59.0) in EMR documentation of lifestyle counseling for patients with hypertension. Changes were smaller for indicators involving clinical actions that automatically update the EMR, such as laboratory testing, with a reduction of 10.7 percentage points (95\% CI, -13.6 to -7.8) in control of cholesterol in patients with coronary heart disease and 12.1 percentage points (95\% CI, -13.6 to -10.6) for thyroid-function testing in patients with hypothyroidism. There was little change in performance on the 6 quality measures for which incentives were maintained. CONCLUSIONS Removal of financial incentives was associated with an immediate decline in performance on quality measures. In part, the decline probably reflected changes in EMR documentation, but declines on measures involving laboratory testing suggest that incentive removal also changed the care delivered.},

A retrospective review was performed to compare (1) the clinical outcomes, as defined by percent mortality and disposition at discharge, between patients with a primary diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage treated in 1995 in medical or surgical ICUs and those treated in the same medical facility in an NSICU in 1997; and (2) the efficiency of care, as defined by length of ICU stay, total cost of care, and specific resource use, between patients treated in the NSICU and national benchmark standards for general ICUs during the 1997 fiscal year (FY). In the latter, extracted patient population data on neurosurgery patients requiring ICU treatment during FY 1997 were used with the following adjacent-disease related group (A-DRG)-coded diseases: craniotomy with and without coma or intracerebral hemorrhage, and skull fracture with and without coma lasting longer than 1 hour. Outcome measures of percent mortality and disposition at discharge in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage were significantly improved (P {$<$} .05), compared with those in a similar cohort treated 2 years earlier in a general ICU setting. Also, patients treated in the NSICU had shorter hospital stays (P {$<$} .01) and lower total costs of care (P {$<$} .01) than a national benchmark. The data suggest that a neuroscience specialty ICU arena staffed by specialty-trained intensivists and nurses is beneficial.}

Clinical scoring systems can predict the mortality and functional outcome after ICH (FUNC score). FOUR score is a recently developed coma scale that incorporates brainstem reflexes. We propose that the combination of FUNC and FOUR scores will be a better prognostic indicator than either FUNC or FOUR score alone for S-ICH patients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all S-ICH patients ({$>$}18 years of age) from January 2008 to May 2010. ICH volume was calculated using the ABC/2 formula. FUNC ({$\leq$}5 or {$>$}5) and FOUR ({$\leq$}10 and {$>$}10) scores were calculated from admission data. Statistical analyses included chi-square test, positive predictive value, and relative risk assessment. Results: Total number of patients was 92. The mean age of presentation was 64.6 {$\pm$} 15.6 years (range: 27\textendash 95 years). Male to female ratio was 1.6:1. Combined FUNC score {$\leq$} 5 and FOUR score {$\leq$} 10 (F2 score; 95\%) had higher positive predictive value for mortality than either FUNC score {$\leq$} 5 (82\%) or FOUR score {$\leq$} 10 (81\%). Conclusions: The combination of the FUNC and the FOUR scoring system is a better prognostication indicator for S-ICH patients than either FUNC or FOUR score.},

Care by expert healthcare providers to optimize neurologic recovery is necessary. Given the lack of an organizational framework and criteria for the development and maintenance of neurological critical care units (NCCUs), this document is put forth by the Neurocritical Care Society (NCS). Recommended organizational structure, personnel and processes necessary to develop a successful neurocritical care program are outlined. Methods: Under the direction of NCS Executive Leadership, a multidisciplinary writing group of NCS members was formed. After an iterative process, a framework was proposed and approved by members of the writing group. A draft was then written, which was reviewed by the NCS Quality Committee and NCS Guidelines Committee, members at large, and posted for public comment. Feedback was formally collated, reviewed and incorporated into the final document which was subsequently approved by the NCS Board of Directors.}

  abstract = {The role of hyperosmolar therapy (HT) in large hemispheric ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes remains a controversial issue. Past and current stroke guidelines state that it represents a reasonable therapeutic measure for patients with either neurological deterioration or intracranial pressure (ICP) elevations documented by ICP monitoring. However, the lack of evidence for a clear effect of this therapy on radiological tissue shifts and clinical outcomes produces uncertainty with respect to the appropriateness of its implementation and duration in the context of radiological mass effect without clinical correlates of neurological decline or documented elevated ICP. In addition, limited data suggest a theoretical potential for harm from the prophylactic and protracted use of HT in the setting of large hemispheric lesions. HT exerts effects on parenchymal volume, cerebral blood volume and cerebral perfusion pressure which may ameliorate global ICP elevation and cerebral blood flow; nevertheless, it also holds theoretical potential for aggravating tissue shifts promoted by significant interhemispheric ICP gradients that may arise in the setting of a large unilateral supratentorial mass lesion. The purpose of this article is to review the literature in order to shed light on the effects of HT on brain tissue shifts and clinical outcome in the context of large hemispheric strokes, as well as elucidate when HT should be initiated and when it should be avoided.},

There are several kinds of interval estimates, but the most popular are confidence intervals (CIs): intervals that contain the true parameter value in some known proportion of repeated samples, on average. The width of confidence intervals is thought to index the precision of an estimate; CIs are thought to be a guide to which parameter values are plausible or reasonable; and the confidence coefficient of the interval (e.g., 95 \%) is thought to index the plausibility that the true parameter is included in the interval. We show in a number of examples that CIs do not necessarily have any of these properties, and can lead to unjustified or arbitrary inferences. For this reason, we caution against relying upon confidence interval theory to justify interval estimates, and suggest that other theories of interval estimation should be used instead.},

Methods: This was a prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study at 4 academic medical centers and one community hospital. Adults (18 years or older) with nontraumatic spontaneous ICH, Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12 or less, who did not have preexisting DNR orders were included. Results: One hundred nine subjects were enrolled. Mean age was 62 years; median Glasgow Coma Scale score was 7, and mean hematoma volume was 39 cm3. Based on ICH Score prediction, the expected overall 30-day mortality rate was 50\%. Observed mortality was substantially lower at 20.2\%, absolute average difference 29.8\% (95\% confidence interval: 21.5\%\textendash 37.7\%). At 90 days, 27.1\% had died, 21.5\% had a modified Rankin Scale score 5 5 (severe disability). A good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0\textendash 3) was achieved by 29.9\% and an additional 21.5\% fell into the moderately severe disability range (modified Rankin Scale score 5 4). Conclusions: Avoidance of early DNR orders along with guideline concordant ICH care results in substantially lower mortality than predicted. The observed functional outcomes in this study provide clinicians and families with data to determine the appropriate goals of treatment based on patients' wishes.

Methods: We analyzed patients enrolled in the Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage II (ATACH-II) randomized controlled trial. Participants were assigned to intensive (systolic BP ,140 mm Hg) vs standard (systolic BP ,180 mm Hg) treatment within 4.5 hours from onset. The following NCCT markers were identified: intrahematoma hypodensities, black hole sign, swirl sign, blend sign, heterogeneous hematoma density, and irregular shape. ICH expansion was defined as hematoma growth .33\% and unfavorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score .3 at 90 days. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of ICH expansion and explore the association between NCCT signs and clinical benefit from intensive BP treatment. Results: A total of 989 patients were included (mean age 62 years, 61.9\% male), of whom 186/869 experienced hematoma expansion (21.4\%) and 361/952 (37.9\%) had unfavorable outcome. NCCT markers independently predicted ICH expansion (all p , 0.01) with overall accuracy ranging from 61\% to 78\% and good interrater reliability (k . 0.6 for all markers). There was no evidence of an interaction between NCCT markers and benefit from intensive BP reduction (all p for interaction .0.10). Conclusions: NCCT signs reliably identify ICH patients at high risk of hematoma growth. However, we found no evidence that patients with these markers specifically benefit from intensive BP reduction.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS SCORE-IT (Spot Sign Score in Restricting ICH Growth) is a preplanned prospective observational study nested in the Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage II (ATACH-II) randomized clinical trial. Participants included consecutive patients with primary ICH who underwent a CTA within 8 hours from onset at 59 sites from May 15, 2011, through December 19, 2015. Data were analyzed for the present study from July 1 to August 31, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Patients in ATACH-II were randomized to intensive (systolic BP target, {$<$}140 mm Hg) vs standard (systolic BP target, {$<$}180 mm Hg) BP reduction within 4.5 hours from onset. Expansion of ICH was defined as hematoma growth of greater than 33\%, and an unfavorable outcome was defined as a 90-day modified Rankin Scale score of 4 or greater (range, 0-6). The association among BP reduction, ICH expansion, and outcome was investigated with multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 133 patients (83 men [62.4\%] and 50 women [37.6\%]; mean [SD] age, 61.9 [13.1] years) were included. Of these, 53 (39.8\%) had a spot sign, and 24 of 123 without missing data (19.5\%) experienced ICH expansion. The spot sign was associated with expansion with sensitivity of 0.54 (95\% CI, 0.34-0.74) and specificity of 0.63 (95\% CI, 0.53-0.72). After adjustment for potential confounders, intensive BP treatment was not associated with a significant reduction of ICH expansion (relative risk, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.27-2.51; P = .74) or improved outcome (relative risk of 90-day modified Rankin Scale score Ն4, 1.24; 95\% CI, 0.53-2.91; P = .62) in spot sign\textendash positive patients.

The following markers were associated with increased risk of HE and poor outcome respectively: black hole sign (OR=3.70, E 95\%confidence interval (CI)=1.42-9.64 and OR=5.26, 95\%CI=1.75-15.76), swirl sign (OR=3.33, 95\%CI=2.42-4.60 and OR=3.70; 95\%CI=2.47-5.55), heterogeneous density (OR=2.74; C 95\%CI=1.71-4.39 and OR=2.80; 95\%CI=1.78-4.39), blend sign (OR=3.49; 95\%CI=2.20-5.55 and OR=2.21; 95\%CI 1.16-4.18), hypodensities (OR=3.47; 95\%CI=2.18-5.50 and OR=2.94; C 95\%CI=2.28-3.78), irregular shape (OR=2.01, 95\% CI=1.27-3.19 and OR=3.43; 95\%CI=2.33A 5.03) and island sign (OR=7.87, 95\% CI=2.17-28.47 and OR=6.05, 95\%CI=4.44-8.24 ). Conclusion: Our results suggest that multiple NCCT ICH shape and density features, with different effect size, are important markers for HE and clinical outcome, and may provide useful information for future randomized controlled trials.},

Design\hspace{0.6em} A survey of stakeholders' opinions on the proposals. Setting\hspace{0.6em} A web-based survey, open to international participation, for those with an interest in visualisation of time-to-event data. Participants\hspace{0.6em} 1174 people participated in the survey over a 6-week period. Participation was global (although primarily Europe and North America) and represented a wide range of researchers (primarily statisticians and clinicians). Main outcome measures\hspace{0.6em} Two outcome measures were of principal importance: (1) participants' opinions of each proposal compared with a `standard' Kaplan\textendash Meier plot; and (2) participants' overall ranking of the proposals (including the standard). Results\hspace{0.6em} Most proposals were more popular than the standard Kaplan\textendash Meier plot. The most popular proposals in the two categories, respectively, were an extended table beneath the plot depicting the numbers at risk, censored and having experienced an event at periodic timepoints, and CIs around each Kaplan\textendash Meier curve. Conclusions\hspace{0.6em} This study produced a high response number, reflecting the importance of graphics for time-toevent data. Those producing and publishing Kaplan\textendash Meier plots\textemdash both authors and journals\textemdash should, as a starting point, consider using the combination of the two favoured proposals.},

Thiamine deficiency is causal and/or contributory in a number of debilitating diseases including beri-beri, the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, optic neuropathy, and others. While thiamine deficiency is relatively rare in developed nations as a result of dietary supplementation, thiamine deficiency is more common in nutritionally compromised populations. Thiamine pyrophosphate, a thiamine derivative, is essential to the citric acid cycle and thiamine deficiency can result in impaired aerobic respiration and cellular energy production. Thiamine also plays an important role in the pentose phosphate pathway and other key metabolic processes. Although thiamine deficiency is a known cause of lactic acidosis, it has been recently evaluated as a potential contributor to refractory lactic acidosis and organ injury in septic shock and other shock states. In this article, we review the epidemiology of thiamine deficiency in septic shock and the existing evidence base supporting thiamine supplementation. We conclude that specific sepsis phenotypes may stand to benefit the most from thiamine supplementation, and efforts might be made to identify and supplement these patients early in their hospital course.},

  abstract = {\ding{51} There is no proof that osmotic agents such as mannitol lower intracranial pressure (ICP) by decreasing brain water content. An alternative mechanism might be a reduction in cerebral blood volume through vasoconstriction. Mannitol, by decreasing blood viscosity, would tend to enhance cerebral blood flow (CBF), but the cerebral vessels would constrict to keep CBF relatively constant, analogous to pressure autoregulation. The cranial window technique was used in this study to measure the pial arteriolar diameter in cats, together with blood viscosity and ICP changes after an intravenous bolus of 1 gm/kg of mannitol. Blood viscosity decreased immediately; the greatest decrease (23\%) occurred at 10 minutes, and at 75 minutes there was a ``rebound'' increase of 10\%. Vessel diameters decreased concomitantly, the largest decrease being 12\% at 10 minutes, which is exactly the same as the 12\% decrease in diameter associated with pronounced hyperventilation (PaCO               2               30 to 19 mm Hg) in the same vessels; at 75 minutes vessel diameter increased by 12\%. With hyperventilation, ICP was decreased by 26\%; 10 minutes after mannitol was given, ICP decreased by 28\%, and at 75 minutes it showed a rebound increase of 40\%. The correlation between blood viscosity and vessel diameter and between vessel diameter and ICP was very high. An alternative explanation is offered for the effect of mannitol on ICP, the time course of ICP changes, the ``rebound effect,'' and the absence of influence on CBF, all with one mechanism.},

  abstract = {Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the most common and disabling complication among patients admitted to the hospital for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Clinical and radiographic methods often fail to detect DCI early enough to avert irreversible injury. We assessed the clinical feasibility of implementing a continuous EEG (cEEG) ischemia monitoring service for early DCI detection as part of an institutional guideline. An institutional neuromonitoring guideline was designed by an interdisciplinary team of neurocritical care, clinical neurophysiology, and neurosurgery physicians and nursing staff and cEEG technologists. The interdisciplinary team focused on (1) selection criteria of high-risk patients, (2) minimization of safety concerns related to prolonged monitoring, (3) technical selection of quantitative and qualitative neurophysiologic parameters based on expert consensus and review of the literature, (4) a structured interpretation and reporting methodology, prompting direct patient evaluation and iterative neurocritical care, and (5) a two-layered quality assurance process including structured clinician interviews assessing events of neurologic worsening and an adjudicated consensus review of neuroimaging and medical records. The resulting guideline's clinical feasibility was then prospectively evaluated. The institutional SAH monitoring guideline used transcranial Doppler ultrasound and cEEG monitoring for vasospasm and ischemia monitoring in patients with either Fisher group 3 or Hunt\textendash Hess grade IV or V SAH. Safety criteria focused on prevention of skin breakdown and agitation. Technical components included monitoring of transcranial Doppler ultrasound velocities and cEEG features, including quantitative alpha:delta ratio and percent alpha variability, qualitative evidence of new focal slowing, late-onset epileptiform activity, or overall worsening of background. Structured cEEG reports were introduced including verbal communication for findings concerning neurologic decline. The guideline was successfully implemented over 27 months, during which neurocritical care physicians referred 71 SAH patients for combined transcranial Doppler ultrasound and cEEG monitoring. The quality assurance process determined a DCI rate of 48\% among the monitored population, more than 90\% of which occurred during the duration of cEEG monitoring (mean 6.9 days) beginning 2.7 days after symptom onset. An institutional guideline implementing cEEG for SAH ischemia monitoring and reporting is feasible to implement and efficiently identify patients at high baseline risk of DCI during the period of monitoring.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate which factors are associated with DWI lesions, whether associated factors differ by ICH location, and whether DWI lesions are associated with functional outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This analysis pooled individual patient data from 3 randomized clinical trials (Minimally Invasive Surgery Plus Alteplase for Intracerebral Hemorrhage Evacuation phase 3 trial, Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage trial, and Intracerebral Hemorrhage Deferoxamine phase 2 trial) and 1 multicenter prospective study (Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage). Patients were enrolled from August 1, 2010, to September 30, 2018. Of the 4782 patients, 1788 who underwent magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain were included. Data were analyzed from July 1 to December 31, 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome consisted of factors associated with DWI lesions. Secondary outcomes were poor functional outcome, defined as a modified Rankin score (mRS) of 4 to 6, and mortality, both assessed at 3 months. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between exposures and outcomes. Subgroup analyses stratified by hematoma location were performed. RESULTS After exclusion of 36 patients with missing data on DWI lesions, 1752 patients were included in the analysis (1019 men [58.2\%]; mean [SD] age, 60.8 [13.3] years). Diffusion-weighted imaging lesions occurred in 549 patients (31.3\%). In mixed-effects regression models, factors associated with DWI lesions included younger age (odds ratio [OR] per year, 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.97-0.99), black race (OR, 1.64; 95\% CI, 1.17-2.30), admission systolic blood pressure (OR per 10\textendash mm Hg increase, 1.13; 95\% CI, 1.08-1.18), baseline hematoma volume (OR per 10-mL increase, 1.12; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.22), cerebral microbleeds (OR, 1.85; 95\% CI, 1.39-2.46), and leukoaraiosis (OR, 1.59; 95\% CI, 1.67-2.17). Diffusion-weighted imaging lesions were independently associated with poor mRS (OR, 1.50; 95\% CI, 1.13-2.00), but not with mortality (OR, 1.11; 95\% CI, 0.72-1.71). In subgroup analyses, similar factors were associated with DWI lesions in lobar and deep ICH. Diffusion-weighted imaging lesions were associated with poor mRS in deep but not lobar ICH. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a large, heterogeneous cohort of prospectively identified patients with ICH, results were consistent with the hypothesis that DWI lesions represent acute sequelae of chronic cerebral small vessel disease, particularly hypertensive vasculopathy. Diffusion-weighted imaging lesions portend a worse prognosis after ICH, mainly deep hemorrhages.},

  abstract = {Background: In severe stroke, a decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatment is sometimes made in cooperation with the family. The aim of this study was to study the time from \-withdrawing life-sustaining treatment to death in patients with severe ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Methods: In total, 2,506 patients with stroke admitted to Haukeland University Hospital between 2006 and 2011 were prospectively registered in the Bergen NORSTROKE database. Risk factors, stroke severity, etiology, and blood analyses were registered. Retrospectively, the patients' records were examined to determine the number of days from withdrawing all life-sustaining treatment to death in patients who died from severe stroke during the hospital stay. Results: Life-sustaining treatment was withheld in 50 patients with severe stroke. Median time to death after withdrawing life-sustaining treatment was 4 days, and a quarter lived at least 1 week (range =1\textendash 11 days). Cox regression analyses showed that short time from withdrawing lifesustaining treatment to death was associated with high age (Hazard ratio [HR] =1.05, P=0.07), male sex (HR =2.9, P=0.01), high C-reactive protein on admission (HR =1.01, P=0.001), and hemorrhagic stroke (versus ischemic stroke, HR =1.5, P=0.03). Conclusion: One week after withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, a quarter of our patients with severe stroke remained alive. Short time to death was associated with high age, male sex, hemorrhagic stroke, and high C-reactive protein on admittance.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash Phenytoin (PHT) is routinely used for seizure prophylaxis after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), but may adversely affect neurologic and cognitive recovery. Methods\textemdash We studied 527 SAH patients and calculated a ``PHT burden'' for each by multiplying the average serum level of PHT by the time in days between the first and last measurements, up to a maximum of 14 days from ictus. Functional outcome at 14 days and 3 months was measured with the modified Rankin scale, with poor functional outcome defined as dependence or worse (modified Rankin Scale Ն4). We assessed cognitive outcomes at 14 days and 3 months with the telephone interview for cognitive status. Results\textemdash PHT burden was associated with poor functional outcome at 14 days (OR, 1.5 per quartile; 95\% CI, 1.3 to 1.8; PϽ0.001), although not at 3 months (Pϭ0.09); the effect remained (OR, 1.6 per quartile; 95\% CI, 1.2 to 2.1; PϽ0.001) after correction for admission Glasgow Coma Scale, fever, stroke, age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale Ն10, hydrocephalus, clinical vasospasm, and aneurysm rebleeding. Seizure in hospital (OR, 4.1; 95\% CI, 1.5 to 11.1; Pϭ0.002) was associated with functional disability in a univariate model only. Higher quartiles of PHT burden were associated with worse telephone interview for cognitive status scores at hospital discharge (PϽ0.001) and at 3 months (Pϭ0.003). Conclusions\textemdash Among patients treated with PHT, burden of exposure to PHT predicts poor neurologic and cognitive outcome after SAH. (Stroke. 2005;36:583-587.)},

  abstract = {Purpose of Review: Persistent elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) can lead to cerebral ischemia, brain herniation, and possibly death. Understanding the fundamental mechanism that contributes to the rise in ICP and recognizing the specific intracranial compartment involved (brain, CSF, or blood) can lead to early diagnosis and effective treatment. This article reviews the conceptual approach to a patient with elevated ICP. Recent Findings: The overall goal for patients with intracranial hypertension is to lower ICP below 20 mm Hg and to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) between 60 mm Hg and 90 mm Hg to provide sufficient cerebral perfusion. Commonly used therapeutic interventions to lower ICP include decompressive surgery, osmotherapy, hyperventilation, barbiturate-induced metabolic suppression, and hypothermia; however, the selection of these interventions must be tailored to each patient by considering the particular diagnosis and intracranial pathophysiology. Emerging evidence suggests that cerebral autoregulation may fail at excessively high CPP (CPP greater than 100 mm Hg) as well as at low CPP (CPP less than 60 mm Hg) and that maximal cerebral autoregulation capacity may be achieved at an optimal CPP of 70 mm Hg to 90 mm Hg.},

Design: An appointed Task Force followed a standard, systematic, and evidence-based approach in reviewing the literature to develop these guidelines. Measurements and Main Results: The assessment of the evidence and recommendations was based on the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. The general subject was addressed in sections: admission criteria and benefits of different levels of care, triage, discharge timing and strategies, use of outreach programs to supplement ICU care, quality assurance\&sol;improvement and metrics, nonbeneficial treatment in the ICU, and rationing considerations. The literature searches yielded 2,404 articles published from January 1998 to October 2013 for review. Following the appraisal of the literature, discussion, and consensus, recommendations were written. Conclusion: Although these are administrative guidelines, the subjects addressed encompass complex ethical and medico-legal aspects of patient care that affect daily clinical practice. A limited amount of high-quality evidence made it difficult to answer all the questions asked related to ICU admission, discharge, and triage. Despite these limitations, the members of the Task Force believe that these recommendations provide a comprehensive framework to guide practitioners in making informed decisions during the admission, discharge, and triage process as well as in resolving issues of nonbeneficial treatment and rationing. We need to further develop preventive strategies to reduce the burden of critical illness, educate our noncritical care colleagues about these interventions, and improve our outreach, developing early identification and intervention systems.}

Clinical decision rules and more sensitive computed tomography (CT) have made the diagnosis of SAH easier, but physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion. The management of these patients is based on a limited number of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Early repair of the ruptured aneurysm by endovascular coiling or neurosurgical clipping is essential, and coiling is superior to clipping in cases amenable to both treatments. Aneurysm repair prevents rebleeding, leaving the most important prognostic factors for outcome early brain injury from the hemorrhage, which is reflected in the neurologic condition of the patient, and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). Observational studies suggest outcomes are better when patients are managed in specialized neurologic intensive care units with inter- or multidisciplinary clinical groups. Medical management aims to minimize early brain injury, cerebral edema, hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure (ICP), and medical complications. Management then focuses on preventing, detecting, and treating DCI. Nimodipine is the only pharmacologic treatment that is approved for SAH in most countries, as no other intervention has demonstrated efficacy. In fact, much of SAH management is derived from studies in other patient populations. Therefore, further study of complications, including DCI and other medical complications, is needed to optimize outcomes for this fragile patient population.},

We compared the proportion of patients who utilized at least one of these resources: neurointensive care unit (NICU), neurosurgical intervention, or clinical trial enrollment.ResultsAmong the 362 patients, 210 (58\%) were transfers. Transferred patients were older, had higher median Glasgow Coma Scale scores, and lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores than directly admitted patients. Transfers had smaller median ICH volumes (20.5\,cc versus 15.2\,cc; P\,=\,.04) and lower ICH scores (2.1\,{$\pm$}\,1.4 versus 1.6\,{$\pm$}\,1.3; P\,{$<$}\,.01). A smaller proportion of transfers utilized CSC-specific resources compared with direct admits (P\,=\,.02). Fewer transferred patients required neurosurgical intervention or were enrolled in trials. No significant difference was found in the proportion of patients who used NICU resources, although transferred patients had a significantly lower length of stay in the NICU. Average hospital stay costs were less for transferred patients than for direct admits.ConclusionsPatients with ICH transferred to our CSC underwent fewer neurosurgical procedures and had a shorter stay in the NICU. These results were reflected in the lower per-patient costs in the transferred group. Our results raise the need to analyze cost\textendash benefits and resource utilization of transferring patients with milder ICH.}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between targeted temperature management at lower target temperatures and the neurologic outcomes among patients classified by the severity of postcardiac arrest syndrome. DESIGN: A multicenter observational study from the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest registry of the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine, which is a nationwide prospective registry of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients. SETTING: A total of 125 critical care medical centers or hospitals with an emergency care department across Japan. PATIENTS: A total of 1,111 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients who had received targeted temperature management. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We divided all 1,111 postcardiac arrest syndrome patients treated with targeted temperature management into two groups: those who received targeted temperature management at a lower target temperature (33\textendash 34\textdegree C) and those who received targeted temperature management at a higher target temperature (35\textendash 36\textdegree C). In regard to classification of the patients, we divided the patients into three categories of severity (low, moderate, and high severities) using the risk classification tool, post-Cardiac Arrest Syndrome for Therapeutic hypothermia, which was previously validated. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients with a good neurologic outcome at 30 days, and the secondary outcome was the survival rate at 30 days. Multivariate analysis showed that targeted temperature management at 33\textendash 34\textdegree C was significantly associated with a good neurologic outcome and survival at 30 days in the moderate severity (odds ratio, 1.70 [95\% CI, 1.03\textendash 2.83] and 1.90 [95\% CI, 1.15\textendash 3.16], respectively), but not in the patients of low or high severity (pinteraction = 0.033). Propensity score analysis also showed that targeted temperature management at 33\textendash 34\textdegree C was associated with a good neurologic outcome in the moderate-severity group (p = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: Targeted temperature management at 33\textendash 34\textdegree C was associated with a significantly higher rate of a good neurologic outcome in the moderate-severity postcardiac arrest syndrome group, but not in the low- or high-severity group.},

We examined the effects on brain tissue oxygen tension (PbtO2) of mannitol and hypertonic saline (HTS) in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and refractory intracranial hypertension. Methods: 12 consecutive patients with severe TBI who underwent intracranial pressure (ICP) and PbtO2 monitoring were studied. Patients were treated with mannitol (25\%, 0.75 g/kg) for episodes of elevated ICP (.20 mm Hg) or HTS (7.5\%, 250 ml) if ICP was not controlled with mannitol. PbtO2, ICP, mean arterial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), central venous pressure and cardiac output were monitored continuously. Results: 42 episodes of intracranial hypertension, treated with mannitol (n = 28 boluses) or HTS (n = 14 boluses), were analysed. HTS treatment was associated with an increase in PbtO2 (from baseline 28.3 (13.8) mm Hg to 34.9 (18.2) mm Hg at 30 min, 37.0 (17.6) mm Hg at 60 min and 41.4 (17.7) mm Hg at 120 min; all p,0.01) while mannitol did not affect PbtO2 (baseline 30.4 (11.4) vs 28.7 (13.5) vs 28.4 (10.6) vs 27.5 (9.9) mm Hg; all p.0.1). Compared with mannitol, HTS was associated with lower ICP and higher CPP and cardiac output. Conclusions: In patients with severe TBI and elevated ICP refractory to previous mannitol treatment, 7.5\% hypertonic saline administered as second tier therapy is associated with a significant increase in brain oxygenation, and improved cerebral and systemic haemodynamics.},

However, there are limited data on the effect of different oxygen regimens on survival and neurological disability in HIE patients. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We undertook a post-hoc analysis of the 166 patients with suspected HIE enrolled in a trial comparing conservative oxygen therapy with usual oxygen therapy in 1000 mechanically ventilated ICU patients. The primary endpoint for the current analysis was death or unfavourable neurological outcome at day 180. Key secondary outcomes were day 180 mortality, and cause-specific mortality. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Patients with HIE allocated to conservative oxygen spent less time in the ICU with an S\- pO2\,{$\geq$}\,97\% (26 h [interquartile range (IQR) 13\textendash 45 vs. 35 h [IQR 19\textendash 70], absolute difference, 9 h; 95\% CI - 21.4 to 3.4). A total of 43 of 78 patients (55.1\%) assigned to conservative oxygen and 49 of 72 patients (68.1\%) assigned to usual oxygen died or had an unfavourable neurological outcome at day 180; odds ratio 0.58; 95\% CI 0.3\textendash 1.12; P\,=\,0.1 adjusted odds ratio 0.54; 95\% CI 0.23\textendash 1.26; P\,=\,0.15.

Defining an appropriate risk threshold to recommend intervention is a key challenge in bringing a risk prediction model to clinical application; such risk thresholds are often defined in an ad hoc way. This is problematic because tacitly assumed costs of false positive and false negative classifications may not be clinically sensible. For example, when choosing the risk threshold that maximizes the proportion of patients correctly classified, false positives and false negatives are assumed equally costly. Furthermore, small to moderate sample sizes may lead to unstable optimal thresholds, which requires a particularly cautious interpretation of results.},

Participants (agreed/strongly agreed: 94\%) reported that strain was best defined as ``a time-varying imbalance between the supply of available beds, staff and/or resources and the demand to provide high-quality care for patients who may become or who are critically ill''; while some recommended defining ``high-quality care'', integrating ``safety'', and families in the definition. Participants reported significant contributors to strain were: ``inability to discharge ICU patients due to lack of available ward beds'' (97\%); ``increases in the volume'' (89\%); and ``acuity and complexity of patients requiring ICU support'' (88\%). Strain was perceived to ``increase stress levels in health care providers'' (98\%); and ``burnout in health care providers'' (96\%). The highest ranked strategies were: ``have more consistent and better goals-of-care conversations with patients/families outside of ICU'' (95\%); and ``increase non-acute care beds'' (92\%). Strain is perceived as common. HCW believe precipitants represent a mix of patient-related and operational factors. Strain is thought to have negative implications for quality of care, HCW well-being and workplace environment. Most indicated strategies ``outside'' of ICU settings were priorities for managing strain.}

Combination of gradual diastolic hypotension and tachycardia could reflect more serious vasodilatory conditions. We sought to evaluate the relationships between heart rate (HR) to diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) ratios and clinical outcomes during early phases of septic shock. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} Diastolic shock index (DSI) was defined as the ratio between HR and DAP. DSI calculated just before start-ing vasopressors (Pre-VPs/DSI) in a preliminary cohort of 337 patients with septic shock (January 2015 to February 2017) and at vasopressor start (VPs/DSI) in 424 patients with septic shock included in a recent randomized controlled trial (ANDROMEDA-SHOCK; March 2017 to April 2018) was partitioned into five quantiles to estimate the relative risks (RR) of death with respect to the mean risk of each population (assumed to be 1). Matched HR and DAP subsamples were created to evaluate the effect of the individual components of the DSI on RRs. In addition, time-course of DSI and interaction between DSI and vasopressor dose (DSI*NE.dose) were compared between survivors and non-survi-vors from both populations, while ROC curves were used to identify variables predicting mortality. Finally, as explora-tory observation, effect of early start of vasopressors was evaluated at each Pre-VPs/DSI quintile from the preliminary cohort. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Risk of death progressively increased at gradual increments of Pre-VPs/DSI or VPs/DSI (One-way ANOVA, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Progressive DAP decrease or HR increase was associated with higher mortality risks only when DSI concom-itantly increased. Areas under the ROC curve for Pre-VPs/DSI, SOFA and initial lactate were similar, while mean arterial pressure and systolic shock index showed poor performances to predict mortality. Time-course of DSI and DSI*NE. dose was significantly higher in non-survivors from both populations (repeated-measures ANOVA, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Very early start of vasopressors exhibited an apparent benefit at higher Pre-VPs/DSI quintile. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} DSI at pre-vasopressor and vasopressor start points might represent a very early identifier of patients at high risk of death. Isolated DAP or HR values do not clearly identify such risk. Usefulness of DSI to trigger or to direct therapeutic interventions in early resuscitation of septic shock need to be addressed in future studies.},

When plasma osmolalities were elevated to toxic levels of 397-432 mOsm/kg H20, brain sodium was increased, whereas plasma sodium was decreased. Brain potassium was not affected. Brain water decreased significantly, concomitant with elevation of plasma osmolality. Both brain lactic acid and [125I]albumin space rose significantly. Brain amino acids (mostly aliphatic and basic amino acids) as well as GABA and glycine (putative inhibitory neurotransmitters) increased after both mannitol and glycerol. Ammonia was stimulated by mannitol but was unaffected by glycerol. Plasma amino acids, which generally increased after mannitol, were decreased by glycerol. When the plasma osmolalities were elevated only to moderate levels (about 350 mOsm/kg HzO), only glycerol induced a significant increase in brain taurine, aspartic acid, alanine, leucine and lysine. Thus, with moderate hyperosmolality, glycerol has striking effects on brain amino acid metabolism that are not observed with mannitol.},

In patients with large space-occupying infarction, the subsequent edema complicated by transtentorial herniation poses a lethal threat. Especially in patients with malignant middle cerebral artery infarction, brain swelling secondary to the vessel occlusion is associated with high mortality. By decompressive craniectomy, a significant proportion of the skull is surgically removed, allowing the ischemic tissue to shift through the surgical defect rather than to the unaffected regions of the brain, thus avoiding secondary damage due to increased intracranial pressure. Several studies have shown that decompressive craniectomy reduces the mortality rate in patients with malignant cerebral artery infarction. However, this is done for the cost of a higher proportion of patients who survive with severe disability. In this review, we will describe the clinical and radiological features of malignant middle cerebral artery infarction and the role of decompressive craniectomy and additional therapies in this condition. We will also discuss large cerebellar stroke and the possibilities of suboccipital craniectomy.},

Objective: To report our institutional experience with intrathecal (IT) nicardipine for treatment of moderate to severe CV. Methods: A retrospective study was performed for all patients treated with intrathecal nicardipine from October 2014-May 2017. The primary goal was to evaluate the safety of IT nicardipine to treat subarachnoid induced CV. Results. 48 patients with aSAH were treated with IT nicardipine for moderate or severe CV. The average age of patients was 49.6 years (range 14\textendash 77 years) with mean Hunt Hess of 3.2 and mean Fisher scores of 3.1. Patients were treated with different dosing regiments ranging from 2 mg q12 to 4 mg q8hr. The average total dose was 35.1 mg (range 6 to 112 mg). The average initiation of treatment was post bleed day 6 (range day 2\textendash 15) and length of treatment was 5.9 days (range 1\textendash 15 days.) 10/48 (20.8\%) patients underwent TBA with only 4/48 (8.3\%) treated after initiation of IT nicardipine. Three patients (6.3\%) developed meningitis/ventriculitis. Three (6.3\%) pa\- tients required ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Favorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale 4 or 5) was achieved in 56.3\% of patients. Conclusions: The use of intrathecal nicardipine should be considered a safe option in the treatment of moderate to severe cerebral vasospasm. The use of intrathecal nicardipine has resulted in a near discontinuation of balloon angioplasty in our institution. Randomized trials to identify the optimal dosing, timing, and length of treatment is warranted.},

  abstract = {Background: Stability of risk estimates from prediction models may be highly dependent on the sample size of the dataset available for model derivation. In this paper, we evaluate the stability of cardiovascular disease risk scores for individual patients when using different sample sizes for model derivation; such sample sizes include those similar to models recommended in the national guidelines, and those based on recently published sample size formula for prediction models. Methods: We mimicked the process of sampling N patients from a population to develop a risk prediction model by sampling patients from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. A cardiovascular disease risk prediction model was developed on this sample and used to generate risk scores for an independent cohort of patients. This process was repeated 1000 times, giving a distribution of risks for each patient. N = 100,000, 50,000, 10,000, Nmin (derived from sample size formula) and Nepv10 (meets 10 events per predictor rule) were considered. The 5\textendash 95th percentile range of risks across these models was used to evaluate instability. Patients were grouped by a risk derived from a model developed on the entire population (population-derived risk) to summarise results. Results: For a sample size of 100,000, the median 5\textendash 95th percentile range of risks for patients across the 1000 models was 0.77\%, 1.60\%, 2.42\% and 3.22\% for patients with population-derived risks of 4\textendash 5\%, 9\textendash 10\%, 14\textendash 15\% and 19\textendash 20\% respectively; for N = 10,000, it was 2.49\%, 5.23\%, 7.92\% and 10.59\%, and for N using the formula-derived sample size, it was 6.79\%, 14.41\%, 21.89\% and 29.21\%. Restricting this analysis to models with high discrimination, good calibration or small mean absolute prediction error reduced the percentile range, but high levels of instability remained. Conclusions: Widely used cardiovascular disease risk prediction models suffer from high levels of instability induced by sampling variation. Many models will also suffer from overfitting (a closely linked concept), but at acceptable levels of overfitting, there may still be high levels of instability in individual risk. Stability of risk estimates should be a criterion when determining the minimum sample size to develop models.},

We sought to evaluate the natural history of infratentorial ICH stratified by brainstem or cerebellar location using a prospective observational study inclusive of all spontaneous ICH. Methods: Using a prospective, single center cohort of patients with spontaneous ICH between 2008-2019, we conducted a descriptive analysis of baseline demographics, severity of injury scores, and long-term functional outcomes of infratentorial ICH stratified by cerebellar or brainstem location. Results: Infratentorial ICH occurred in 82 (13\%) of 632 patients in our ICH cohort. Among infratentorial ICH, cerebellar ICH occurred in 45 (55\%) and brainstem ICH occurred in 37 (45\%). Compared to cerebellar ICH, patients with brainstem ICH had significantly worse severity of injury scores, including lower admission Glasgow Coma Scale (median 14 [7.0 \`A 15.0] versus 4 [3.0 \`A 8.0], respectively; P {$<$} 0.001) and higher ICH Score (median 2 [1.0 \`A 3.0] versus 3 [2.75 \`A 4.0], respectively; P = 0.02). Patients with cerebellar ICH were more likely to be discharged home or to acute rehabilitation (OR 4.8, 95\% CI 1.8 \`A 12.8) but there was no difference in in-hospital mortality (OR 0.4, 95\% CI 0.1 \`A 1.1, P = 0.08) or cause of death (P = 0.5). Modified Rankin Scale scores at 3 months were significantly better in patients with cerebellar ICH compared to brainstem ICH (median 3.5 [1.8 - 6.0] versus median 6 [5.0 - 6.0], P = 0.03). Conclusions: Location of infratentorial ICH is an important determinant of admission severity and clinical outcome in unselected patients with ICH. Patients with cerebellar ICH have less severe symptoms at presentation and more favorable functional outcomes compared to patients with brainstem ICH.},

  author = {Pate, Alexander},
  year = {2019},
  pages = {16},
  abstract = {Background: Risk prediction models are commonly used in practice to inform decisions on patients' treatment. Uncertainty around risk scores beyond the confidence interval is rarely explored. We conducted an uncertainty analysis of the QRISK prediction tool to evaluate the robustness of individual risk predictions with varying modelling decisions. Methods: We derived a cohort of patients eligible for cardiovascular risk prediction from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) with linked hospitalisation and mortality records (N = 3,855,660). Risk prediction models were developed using the methods reported for QRISK2 and 3, before adjusting for additional risk factors, a secular trend, geographical variation in risk and the method for imputing missing data when generating a risk score (model A\textendash model F). Ten-year risk scores were compared across the different models alongside model performance metrics. Results: We found substantial variation in risk on the individual level across the models. The 95 percentile range of risks in model F for patients with risks between 9 and 10\% according to model A was 4.4\textendash 16.3\% and 4.6\textendash 15.8\% for females and males respectively. Despite this, the models were difficult to distinguish using common performance metrics (Harrell's C ranged from 0.86 to 0.87). The largest contributing factor to variation in risk was adjusting for a secular trend (HR per calendar year, 0.96 [0.95\textendash 0.96] and 0.96 [0.96\textendash 0.96]). When extrapolating to the UK population, we found that 3.8 million patients may be reclassified as eligible for statin prescription depending on the model used. A key limitation of this study was that we could not assess the variation in risk that may be caused by risk factors missing from the database (such as diet or physical activity). Conclusions: Risk prediction models that use routinely collected data provide estimates strongly dependent on modelling decisions. Despite this large variability in patient risk, the models appear to perform similarly according to standard performance metrics. Decision-making should be supplemented with clinical judgement and evidence of additional risk factors. The largest source of variability, a secular trend in CVD incidence, can be accounted for and should be explored in more detail.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash Suboccipital decompressive craniectomy (SDC) is a life-saving intervention for patients with malignant cerebellar infarction. However, long-term outcome has not been systematically analyzed. Methods\textemdash In this monocentric retrospective study we analyzed mortality, long-term functional outcome, and quality of life of all consecutive patients that were treated by SDC for malignant cerebellar infarction in our institution between 1995 and 2006. Results\textemdash A total of 57 patients were identified. All of them were treated by bilateral SDC. An external ventricular drainage was inserted in 82\%, necrotic tissue was evacuated in 56\% of patients. There were no fatal procedural complications. Five patients were lost for follow-up. In the remaining 52 patients, the mean follow-up interval was 4.7 years (1 to 11 years). Within the first 6 months after surgery 16 of 57 patients (28\%) had died. At follow-up, 21 of 52 patients (40\%) had died and 4 patients (8\%) lived with major disability (mRS 4 or 5). Twenty-one patients (40\%) lived functionally independent (mRS 0 to 2). The presence of additional brain stem infarction was associated with poor outcome (mRS Ն4; hazard ratio: 9.1; Pϭ0.001). Quality of life in survivors was moderately lower than in healthy controls. Conclusions\textemdash SDC is a safe procedure in patients with malignant cerebellar infarction. Infarct- but not procedure-related early mortality is substantial. Long-term outcome in survivors is acceptable, particularly in the absence of brain stem infarction. (Stroke. 2009;40:3045-3050.)},

  abstract = {Purpose:\hspace{0.6em} Recent evidence questions a liberal approach to fluid resuscitation in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Here, we assess whether use of hypertonic saline applied as single infusion at ICU admission after cardiac surgery can reduce cumulative perioperative fluid volume. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} Prospective randomized double-blind single-center clinical trial investigates effects of a single infusion of hypertonic saline (HS) versus normal saline (comparator). Primary endpoint was the cumulative amount of fluid administered in patients in the hypertonic saline versus the 0.9\% saline groups (during ICU stay). Upon ICU admission, patients received a single infusion of 5 ml/kg body weight of 7.3\% NaCl (or 0.9\% NaCl) over 60 min. Patients undergoing cardiac surgery for elective valvular and/or coronary heart disease were included. Patients with advanced organ dysfunction, infection, and/or patients on chronic steroid medication were excluded. Results:\hspace{0.6em} A total of 101 patients were randomized to receive the study intervention (HS n\,=\,53, NS n\,=\,48). Cumulative fluid intake on the ICU (primary endpoint) did not differ between the HS and the NS groups [median 3193 ml (IQR 2052\textendash 4333 ml) vs. 3345 ml (IQR 2332\textendash 5043 ml)]. Postoperative urinary output until ICU discharge was increased in HS-treated patients [median 2250 ml (IQR 1640\textendash 2690 ml) vs. 1545 ml (IQR 1087\textendash 1976 ml)], and ICU fluid balance was lower in the HS group when compared to the NS group [296 ml (IQR -\,441 to 1412 ml) vs. 1137 ml (IQR 322\textendash 2660 ml)]. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} In a monocentric prospective double-blind randomized clinical trial, we observed that hypertonic saline did not reduce the total fluid volume administered on the ICU in critically ill cardiac surgery patients. Hypertonic saline infusion was associated with timely increase in urinary output. Variations in electrolyte and acid\textendash base homeostasis were transient, but substantial in all patients.},

  abstract = {Mannitol is currently used to reduce intracranial pressure (ICP), but the evidence supporting its usefulness has been questioned. We aim to meta-analyze the effectiveness of mannitol in reducing ICP in adult patients with cerebral inju-ries and its dependency on baseline ICP values, comparing findings from individual patient data (IPD) and aggregated data (AD) meta-analysis performed on the same studies. We searched the Medline database, with no time limitation, through March 1, 2019. We selected studies for which IPD were available, with a before-after design, concerning adult patients with traumatic cerebral hemorrhages, subarachnoid hemorrhages, or hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, treated with mannitol for increased intracranial hypertension. We extracted ICP values at baseline and at different time-points, and mannitol doses. We used a multilevel approach to account for multiple measurements on the same patient and for center variability. The AD meta-analysis and meta-regression were conducted using random-effects models. Three studies published IPD, and four authors shared their datasets. Two authors did not own their datasets anymore. Eight authors were unreachable, while 14 did not answer to our request. Overall, 7 studies provided IPD for 98 patients. The linear mixed-effects model showed that ICP decreased significantly after mannitol administration from an average baseline value of 22.1 mmHg to 16.8, 12.8, and 9.7 mmHg at 60, 120, and 180 min after mannitol administration. ICP reduction was proportional to baseline values with a 0.64 mmHg decrease for each unitary incre-ment of the initial ICP value. Dose did not influence ICP reduction. The AD meta-analysis, based on data collected between 30 and 60 min from mannitol administration not accounting for multiple time-point measurements, over-estimated ICP reduction (10 mmHg), while meta-regression provided similar results (0.66 mmHg decrease for each unitary increase of initial ICP). Mannitol is effective in reducing pathological ICP, proportionally to the degree of intrac-ranial hypertension. IPD meta-analysis provided a more precise quantification of ICP variation than the AD approach.},

Mortality during the first 60 days before discharge home was the primary outcome. Results The groups had similar baseline characteristics. The rates of death during the first 60 days before discharge home were similar in the PAC and CVC groups (27.4 percent and 26.3 percent, respectively; P=0.69; absolute difference, 1.1 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, \textendash 4.4 to 6.6 percent), as were the mean ({$\pm$}SE) numbers of both ventilator-free days (13.2{$\pm$}0.5 and 13.5{$\pm$}0.5; P = 0.58) and days not spent in the intensive care unit (12.0{$\pm$}0.4 and 12.5{$\pm$}0.5; P = 0.40) to day 28.

There were no significant differences between groups in lung or kidney function, rates of hypotension, ventilator settings, or use of dialysis or vasopressors. Approximately 90 percent of protocol instructions were followed in both groups, with a 1 percent rate of crossover from CVC- to PAC-guided therapy. Fluid balance was similar in the two groups, as was the proportion of instructions given for fluid and diuretics. Dobutamine use was uncommon. The PAC group had approximately twice as many catheter-related complications (predominantly arrhythmias). The members of the Writing Committee (Arthur P. Wheeler, M.D., and Gordon R.

Conclusions PAC-guided therapy did not improve survival or organ function but was associated with more complications than CVC-guided therapy. These results, when considered with those of previous studies, suggest that the PAC should not be routinely used for the management of acute lung injury. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00281268.)},

Results The majority of surrogates (82\%) preferred numeric estimates describing the patient's prognosis, as they felt it would increase prognostic certainty, and limit the uncertainty perceived as frustrating. Conversely, 75\% of the physicians reported intentionally omitting numeric estimates during prognostication meetings due to low confidence in family members' abilities to appropriately interpret probabilities, worry about creating false hope, and distrust in the accuracy and data quality of existing TBI outcome models. Physicians felt that these models are for research only and should not be applied to individual patients. Surrogates valued compassion during prognostication discussions, and acceptance of their goals-of-care decision by clinicians. Physicians and surrogates agreed on avoiding false hope. Conclusion We identified fundamental differences in the communication preferences of prognostic information between ciTBI patient surrogates and physicians. These findings inform the content of a future decision aid for goals-of-care discussions in ciTBI patients. If validated, these findings may have important implications for improving communication practices in the neurointensive care unit independent of whether a formal decision aid is used.},

METHODS We randomly assigned eligible participants with intracerebral hemorrhage (volume, {$<$}60 cm3) and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 5 or more (on a scale from 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating worse condition) to a systolic blood-pressure target of 110 to 139 mm Hg (intensive treatment) or a target of 140 to 179 mm Hg (standard treatment) in order to test the superiority of intensive reduction of systolic blood pressure to standard reduction; intravenous nicardipine to lower blood pressure was administered within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. The primary outcome was death or disability (modified Rankin scale score of 4 to 6, on a scale ranging from 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) at 3 months after randomization, as ascertained by an investigator who was unaware of the treatment assignments. RESULTS Among 1000 participants with a mean ({$\pm$}SD) systolic blood pressure of 200.6{$\pm$}27.0 mm Hg at baseline, 500 were assigned to intensive treatment and 500 to standard treatment. The mean age of the patients was 61.9 years, and 56.2\% were Asian. Enrollment was stopped because of futility after a prespecified interim analysis. The primary outcome of death or disability was observed in 38.7\% of the participants (186 of 481) in the intensive-treatment group and in 37.7\% (181 of 480) in the standard-treatment group (relative risk, 1.04; 95\% confidence interval, 0.85 to 1.27; analysis was adjusted for age, initial GCS score, and presence or absence of intraventricular hemorrhage). Serious adverse events occurring within 72 hours after randomization that were considered by the site investigator to be related to treatment were reported in 1.6\% of the patients in the intensive-treatment group and in 1.2\% of those in the standard-treatment group. The rate of renal adverse events within 7 days after randomization was significantly higher in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group (9.0\% vs. 4.0\%, P\,=\,0.002).

  abstract = {Object.               Hypervolemia and hypertension therapy is routinely used for prophylaxis and treatment of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm at many institutions. Nevertheless, there is an ongoing debate about the preferred modality (hypervolemia, hypertension, or both), the degree of therapy (moderate or aggressive), and the risk or benefit of hypervolemia, moderate hypertension, and aggressive hypertension in patients following subarachnoid hemorrhage.                                         Methods.               Monitoring data and patient charts for 45 patients were retrospectively searched to identify periods of hypervolemia, moderate hypertension, or aggressive hypertension. Measurements of central venous pressure, fluid input, urine output, arterial blood pressure, intracranial pressure, and oxygen partial pressure (PO               2               ) in the brain tissue were extracted from periods ranging from 1 hour to 24 hours. For these periods, the change in brain tissue PO               2               and the incidence of complications were analyzed.                                         During the 55 periods of moderate hypertension, an increase in brain tissue PO               2               was found in 50 cases (90\%), with complications occurring in three patients (8\%). During the 25 periods of hypervolemia, an increase in brain oxygenation was found during three intervals (12\%), with complications occurring in nine patients (53\%). During the 10 periods of aggressive hypervolemic hypertension, an increase in brain oxygenation was found during six of the intervals (60\%), with complications in five patients (50\%).                                         Conclusions.               When hypervolemia treatment is applied as in this study, it may be associated with increased risks. Note, however, that further studies are needed to determine the role of this therapeutic modality in the care of patients with cerebral vasospasm. In poor-grade patients, moderate hypertension (cerebral perfusion pressure 80\textendash 120 mm Hg) in a normovolemic, hemodiluted patient is an effective method of improving cerebral oxygenation and is associated with a lower complication rate compared with hypervolemia or aggressive hypertension therapy.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The management of cerebellar infarctions is controversial. The aim of this study was to determine which patients require surgical treatment and which surgical procedure should be performed when a patient with a cerebellar infarction exhibits progressive neurological deterioration. METHODS: A total of 44 patients (24 male and 20 female patients; average age, 56 yr) were treated at our institution for cerebellar infarctions in the past 8 years. Twenty-five patients received conservative treatment; two patients who were deeply comatose received no treatment. The remaining 17 patients underwent emergency surgery. Of those 17 patients, 8 underwent external ventricular drainage alone, 5 underwent external ventricular drainage as the first treatment plus secondary suboccipital craniectomy, and 4 underwent suboccipital craniectomy, with removal of necrotic tissue, as the first treatment. RESULTS: Of the 25 conservatively treated patients, 20 experienced good outcomes, 4 experienced moderate outcomes, and 1 died as a result of pulmonary embolism. Of the 17 surgically treated patients, 10 experienced good functional recoveries (7 treated with external ventricular drainage only and 3 treated with drainage followed by suboccipital craniectomy) and 3 survived with mild neurological deficits (one patient underwent ventriculostomy, one suboccipital craniectomy plus external ventricular drainage, and one suboccipital craniectomy only). The overall mortality rate was 13.6\% (6 of 44 patients). CONCLUSION: For patients with worsening levels of consciousness and radiologically evident ventricular enlargement, we recommend external ventricular drainage. We reserve surgical resection of necrotic tissue for patients whose clinical status worsens despite ventriculostomy, those for whom worsening is accompanied by signs of brainstem compression, and those with tight posterior fossae.},

  author = {Rafi, Zad},

  pages = {13},
  abstract = {Background: Researchers often misinterpret and misrepresent statistical outputs. This abuse has led to a large literature on modification or replacement of testing thresholds and P-values with confidence intervals, Bayes factors, and other devices. Because the core problems appear cognitive rather than statistical, we review some simple methods to aid researchers in interpreting statistical outputs. These methods emphasize logical and information concepts over probability, and thus may be more robust to common misinterpretations than are traditional descriptions. Methods: We use the Shannon transform of the P-value p, also known as the binary surprisal or S-value s = -log2(p), to provide a measure of the information supplied by the testing procedure, and to help calibrate intuitions against simple physical experiments like coin tossing. We also use tables or graphs of test statistics for alternative hypotheses, and interval estimates for different percentile levels, to thwart fallacies arising from arbitrary dichotomies. Finally, we reinterpret P-values and interval estimates in unconditional terms, which describe compatibility of data with the entire set of analysis assumptions. We illustrate these methods with a reanalysis of data from an existing record-based cohort study. Conclusions: In line with other recent recommendations, we advise that teaching materials and research reports discuss P-values as measures of compatibility rather than significance, compute P-values for alternative hypotheses whenever they are computed for null hypotheses, and interpret interval estimates as showing values of high compatibility with data, rather than regions of confidence. Our recommendations emphasize cognitive devices for displaying the compatibility of the observed data with various hypotheses of interest, rather than focusing on single hypothesis tests or interval estimates. We believe these simple reforms are well worth the minor effort they require.},

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigate the effect of beta-blockers on outcome after aSAH. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} The review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019111784). We performed a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, published conference proceedings, and abstracts. Eligible studies included both randomized controlled trials and observational studies up to October 2018, reporting the effect of beta-blocker therapy on the following outcomes in aSAH: mortality, vasospasm, delayed cerebral ischemia, infarction or stroke, cardiac dysfunction, and functional outcomes. Studies involving traumatic SAH were excluded. Citations were reviewed, and data extracted independently by two investigators using a standardized proforma. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We identified 819 records with 16 studies (four were randomized controlled trials) including 6702 patients selected for analysis. Exposure to beta-blockade either before or after aSAH was associated with a significant reduction in unadjusted mortality (RR 0.63, 95\% CI 0.42\textendash 0.93, p\,=\,0.02). A significant reduction in unadjusted mortality was also seen in prospective trials of post-event beta-blockade (RR 0.51, 95\% CI 0.28\textendash 0.93, p\,=\,0.03). Statistically significant differences were not seen for other outcomes investigated. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} In adult patients with aSAH, beta-blocker therapy is associated with a mortality benefit. Studies are generally of a low quality with considerable clinical heterogeneity. Prospective large interventional trials with patient centered outcomes are required to validate this finding.},

  abstract = {Background: Endotracheal suctioning (ES) provokes a cumulative hemodynamic response by activation of sympathetic and parasympathetic circuits in the central nervous system. In this proof-of-concept study, we aimed to analyze hemodynamic changes during ES in ventilated subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients and investigated whether the associated hemodynamic changes relate to the time to arousal and functional outcome. Methods: For the current observational study, 191 SAH patients admitted to the neurological intensive care unit of a tertiary hospital requiring mechanical ventilation were included. One thousand eighty ES episodes during the first 72 h of admission were analyzed. Baseline median heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were compared to peak HR and MAP during ES based on 5-min averaged data ({$\Delta$}HR and {$\Delta$}MAP). Multivariable analysis to assess associations between {$\Delta$}HR and {$\Delta$}MAP and time to arousal (time to Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale {$\geq$} 0, RASS) and poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale Score {$>$} 2, mRS) was performed using generalized estimating equations. Results: Patients were 59 (IQR, 50\textendash 70) years old and presented with a median admission H\&H grade of 4 (IQR, 3\textendash 5). Inhospital mortality was 22\% (25\% at 3 months) and median time to arousal was 13 (IQR, 4\textendash 21) days. HR increased by 2.3 {$\pm$} 7.1 beats per minute (bpm) from 75.1 {$\pm$} 14.8 bpm at baseline. MAP increased by 3.2 {$\pm$} 7.8 mmHg from baseline 80.9 {$\pm$} 9.8 mmHg. In multivariable analysis, {$\Delta$}HR (p {$<$} 0.001) was significantly lower in patients who regained consciousness at a later time point and a lower {$\Delta$}HR was associated with poor functional 3-month outcome independent of RASS (adjOR = 0.95; 95\% CI = 0.93\textendash 0.98) or midazolam dose (adjOR = 0.96; 95\% CI = 0.94\textendash 0.98). {$\Delta$}MAP was neither associated with the time to regain consciousness (p = 0.087) nor with functional outcome (p = 0.263). Conclusion: Augmentation in heart rate may quantify the hemodynamic response during endotracheal suctioning in brain-injured patients. The value as a biomarker to early discriminate the time to arousal and functional outcome in acutely brain-injured patients needs prospective confirmation.},

However, not all patients with good endovascular results achieve good outcomes. We sought to understand the clinical significance of magnetic resonance imaging defined infarct growth despite adequate reperfusion and identify associated clinical and radiographic variables. METHODS: History, presentation, treatments, and outcomes for consecutive EVT patients at a referral center were collected. Adequate reperfusion was defined as thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) score 2b-3. Region-specific infarct volumes in white matter, cortex, and basal ganglia were determined on diffusion-weighted imaging. Infarct growth was defined as post-EVT minus pre-EVT volume. Good outcome was defined as 90-day modified Rankin Scale {$\leq$}2. RESULTS: Forty-four patients with adequate reperfusion were identified with median age 72 years; 64\% were women. Each region showed infarct growth: white matter (median pre-EVT 7 cubic centimeters [cc], post-EVT 16 cc), cortex (4 cc, 15 cc), basal ganglia (2 cc, 4 cc), total (20 cc, 39 cc). In multivariable regression, total infarct growth independently decreased the odds of good outcome (odds ratio = .946, 95\% CI = .897, .998). Further multivariable analyses for determinants of infarct growth identified female sex was associated with less total growth ({$\beta$} = -.294, P = .042), TICI 3 was associated with less white matter growth ({$\beta$} = -.277, P = .048) and cortical growth ({$\beta$} = -.335, P = .017), and both female sex ({$\beta$} = -.332, P = .015) and coronary disease ({$\beta$} = -.337, P = .015) were associated with less cortical growth. CONCLUSIONS: Infarct growth occurred despite adequate reperfusion, disproportionately in the cortex, and independently decreased the odds of good outcome. Infarct growth occurred while patients were hospitalized and may represent a therapeutic target. Potential determinants of region-specific infarct growth were identified that require confirmation in larger studies.},

According to a version of the principle defended here, one should take reasonable measures to avoid threats that are serious and plausible. The reasonableness of a response to a threat depends on several factors, including benefit vs. harm, realism, proportionality, and consistency. Since a concept of reasonableness plays an essential role in applying the precautionary principle, this principle gives physicians and patients a decision-making strategy that encourages the careful weighing and balancing of different values that one finds in humanistic approaches to clinical reasoning. Properly understood, the principle presents a worthwhile alternative to approaches to clinical reasoning that apply expected utility theory to decision problems.},

  abstract = {Strained intensive care unit (ICU) capacity represents a fundamental supply-demand mismatch in ICU resources. Strain is likely to be influenced by a range of factors; however, there has been no systematic evaluation of the spectrum of measures that may indicate strain on ICU capacity. We performed a systematic review to identify indicators of strained capacity. A comprehensive peer-reviewed search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science Core Collection was performed along with selected grey literature sources. We included studies published in English after 1990. We included studies that: (1) focused on ICU settings; (2) included description of a quality or performance measure; and (3) described strained capacity. Retrieved studies were screened, selected and extracted in duplicate. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS). Analysis was descriptive. Of 5297 studies identified in our search; 51 fulfilled eligibility. Most were cohort studies (n = 39; 76.5\%), five (9.8\%) were case-control, three (5.8\%) were cross-sectional, two (3.9\%) were modeling studies, one (2\%) was a correlational study, and one (2\%) was a quality improvement project. Most observational studies were high quality. Sixteen measures designed to indicate strain were identified 110 times, and classified as structure (n = 4, 25\%), process (n = 7, 44\%) and outcome (n = 5, 31\%) indicators, respectively. The most commonly identified indicators of strain were ICU acuity (n = 21; 19.1\% [process]), ICU readmission (n = 18; 16.4\% [outcome]), after-hours discharge (n = 15; 13.6\% [process]) and ICU census (n = 13; 11.8\% [structure]). There was substantial heterogeneity in the operational definitions used to define strain indicators across studies. We identified and characterized 16 indicators of strained ICU capacity across the spectrum of healthcare quality domains. Future work should aim to evaluate their implementation into practice and assess their value for evaluating strategies to mitigate strain.

Methods We performed a single-center cohort study on consecutive patients with ICH admitted over 12 months. ICH features were prospectively adjudicated, and WLST and corresponding hospital day were recorded retrospectively. Patients were categorized using DSM-5 criteria as never delirious, ever delirious (either on admission or later during hospitalization), or persistently comatose. We determined the impact of delirium on WLST using Cox regression models adjusted for demographics and ICH predictors (including Glasgow Coma Scale score), then used logistic regression with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to compare the accuracy of ICH score\textendash based models with and without delirium category in predicting WLST. Results Of 311 patients (mean age 70.6 {$\pm$} 15.6, median ICH score 1 [interquartile range 1\textendash 2]), 50\% had delirium. WLST occurred in 26\%, and median time to WLST was 1 day (0\textendash 6). WLST was more frequent in patients who developed delirium (adjusted hazard ratio 8.9 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.1\textendash 37.6]), with high rates of WLST in both early (occurring {$\leq$}24 hours from admission) and later delirium groups. An ICH score-based model was strongly predictive of WLST (area under the curve [AUC] 0.902 [95\% CI 0.863\textendash 0.941]), and the addition of delirium category further improved the model's accuracy (AUC 0.936 [95\% CI 0.909\textendash 0.962], p = 0.004). Conclusion Delirium is associated with WLST after ICH regardless of when it occurs. Further study on the impact of delirium on clinician and surrogate decision-making is warranted.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies suggest that the incidence of sepsis has been steadily increasing over the past several decades while mortality rates are falling. However, reliably assessing trends in sepsis epidemiology is challenging due to changing diagnosis and coding practices over time. Ongoing efforts by clinicians, administrators, policy makers, and patient advocates to increase sepsis awareness, screening, and recognition are leading to more patients being labeled with sepsis. Subjective clinical definitions and heterogeneous presentations also allow for wide discretion in diagnosing sepsis rather than specific infections alone or nonspecific syndromes. These factors create a potential ascertainment bias whereby the inclusion of less severely ill patients in sepsis case counts over time leads to a perceived increase in sepsis incidence and decrease in sepsis mortality rates. Analyses that rely on administrative data alone are further confounded by changing coding practices in response to new policies, financial incentives, and efforts to improve documentation. An alternate strategy for measuring sepsis incidence, outcomes, and trends is to use objective and consistent clinical criteria rather than administrative codes or registries to identify sepsis. This is feasible using data routinely found in electronic health record systems, such as blood culture draws and sustained courses of antibiotics to identify infection and laboratory values, vasopressors, and mechanical ventilation to measure acute organ dysfunction. Recent surveillance studies using this approach suggest that sepsis incidence and mortality rates have been essentially stable over the past decade. In this review, we summarize the major epidemiologic studies of sepsis trends, potential biases in these analyses, and the recent change in the surveillance paradigm toward using objective clinical data from electronic health records to more accurately characterize sepsis trends.},

Methods:\hspace{0.6em} An international consensus panel was convened including 29 clinician-scientists in intensive care medicine with expertise in acute respiratory failure, neurointensive care, or both, and two non-voting methodologists. The panel was divided into seven subgroups, each addressing a predefined clinical practice domain relevant to patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with ABI, defined as acute traumatic brain or cerebrovascular injury. The panel conducted systematic searches and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method was used to evaluate evidence and formulate questions. A modified Delphi process was implemented with four rounds of voting in which panellists were asked to respond to questions (rounds 1\textendash 3) and then recommendation statements (final round). Strong recommendation, weak recommendation, or no recommendation were defined when\,{$>$}\,85\%, 75\textendash 85\%, and\,{$<$}\,75\% of panellists, respectively, agreed with a statement. Results:\hspace{0.6em} The GRADE rating was low, very low, or absent across domains. The consensus produced 36 statements (19 strong recommendations, 6 weak recommendations, 11 no recommendation) regarding airway management, non-invasive respiratory support, strategies for mechanical ventilation, rescue interventions for respiratory failure, ventilator liberation, and tracheostomy in brain-injured patients. Several knowledge gaps were identified to inform future research efforts. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} This consensus provides guidance for the care of patients admitted to the ICU with ABI. Evidence was generally insufficient or lacking, and research is needed to demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of different management approaches.},

Rational choice models require potential outcomes (e.g., benefits/costs) to be weighted by their probability of occurrence. Indeed, the subjective likelihood of being apprehended is the central construct in criminological deterrence theory\textemdash the so-called certainty principle. Yet, extant literature has measured the construct inconsistently and with little attention to potential consequences. Using a series of randomized experiments conducted with nationwide samples of American adults (aged 18 and over), this study examines the degree of correspondence between verbal and numeric measures of apprehension risk, assesses the durability of numeric estimates specifically, and attempts to elicit how respondents naturally think about apprehension risk. The findings suggest that laypeople are somewhat inconsistent in their use of both verbal and numeric descriptors of probability, their numeric estimates of probability are unlikely to be precise or durable, and many seem to prefer thinking of risk in verbal terms (compared to numeric terms). Researchers should consider including both verbal and numeric measures of probability and explore alternative measurement strategies, including anchoring vignettes, which have been valuable in standardizing verbal responses in other disciplines.},

We sought to identify racial/ethnic differences in presentation and outcomes for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods: The American Heart Association COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry is a retrospective observational registry capturing consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We present data on the first 7,868 patients by race/ethnicity treated at 88 hospitals across the US between 01/17/2020 and 7/22/2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality; secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: death, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure) and COVID-19 cardiorespiratory ordinal severity score (worst to best: death, cardiac arrest, mechanical ventilation with mechanical circulatory support, mechanical ventilation with vasopressors/inotrope support, mechanical ventilation without hemodynamic support, and hospitalization without any of the above). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between race/ethnicity and each outcome adjusting for differences in sociodemographic, clinical, and presentation features, and accounting for clustering by hospital. Results: Among 7,868 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 33.0\% were Hispanic, 25.5\% were non-Hispanic Black, 6.3\% were Asian, and 35.2\% were non-Hispanic White. Hispanic and Black patients were younger than non-Hispanic White and Asian patients and were more likely to be uninsured. Black patients had the highest prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Black patients also had the highest rates of mechanical ventilation (23.2\%) and renal replacement therapy (6.6\%) but the lowest rates of remdesivir use (6.1\%). Overall mortality was 18.4\% with 53\% of all deaths occurring in Black and Hispanic patients. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for mortality were 0.93 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.14) for Black patients, 0.90 (95\% CI 0.73-1.11) for Hispanic patients, and 1.31 (95\% CI 0.96-1.80) for Asian patients compared with non-Hispanic White patients. The median OR across hospitals was 1.99 (95\% CI 1.74-2.48). Results were similar for MACE. Asian patients had the highest COVID-19 cardiorespiratory severity at presentation (adjusted OR 1.48, 95\% CI 1.16-1.90). Conclusions: Although in-hospital mortality and MACE did not differ by race/ethnicity after adjustment, Black and Hispanic patients bore a greater burden of mortality and morbidity due to their disproportionate representation among COVID-19 hospitalizations.},

We investigated whether lower admission hemoglobin levels are associated with more hematoma expansion (HE) after ICH and whether this mediates lower hemoglobin levels' association with worse outcomes. Methods Consecutive patients enrolled between 2009 and 2016 to a single-center prospective ICH cohort study with admission hemoglobin and neuroimaging data to calculate HE ({$>$}33\% or {$>$}6 mL) were evaluated. The association of admission hemoglobin levels with HE and poor clinical outcomes using modified Rankin Scale (mRS 4\textendash 6) were assessed using separate multivariable logistic regression models. Mediation analysis investigated causal associations among hemoglobin, HE, and outcome. Results Of 256 patients with ICH meeting inclusion criteria, 63 (25\%) had HE. Lower hemoglobin levels were associated with increased odds of HE (odds ratio [OR] 0.80 per 1.0 g/dL change of hemoglobin; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.67\textendash 0.97) after adjusting for previously identified covariates of HE (admission hematoma volume, antithrombotic medication use, symptom onset to admission CT time) and hemoglobin (age, sex). Lower hemoglobin was also associated with worse 3-month outcomes (OR 0.76 per 1.0 g/dL change of hemoglobin; 95\% CI 0.62\textendash 0.94) after adjusting for ICH score. Mediation analysis revealed that associations of lower hemoglobin with poor outcomes were mediated by HE (p = 0.01). Conclusions Further work is required to replicate the associations of lower admission hemoglobin levels with increased odds of HE mediating worse outcomes after ICH. If confirmed, an investigation into whether hemoglobin levels can be a modifiable target of treatment to improve ICH outcomes may be warranted.},

  abstract = {Introduction: In clinical trials, ordinal outcome measures are often dichotomized into two categories. In traumatic brain injury (TBI) the 5-point Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) is collapsed into unfavourable versus favourable outcome. Simulation studies have shown that exploiting the ordinal nature of the GOS increases chances of detecting treatment effects. The objective of this study is to quantify the benefits of ordinal analysis in the real-life situation of a large TBI trial. Methods: We used data from the CRASH trial that investigated the efficacy of corticosteroids in TBI patients (n = 9,554). We applied two techniques for ordinal analysis: proportional odds analysis and the sliding dichotomy approach, where the GOS is dichotomized at different cut-offs according to baseline prognostic risk. These approaches were compared to dichotomous analysis. The information density in each analysis was indicated by a Wald statistic. All analyses were adjusted for baseline characteristics. Results: Dichotomous analysis of the six-month GOS showed a non-significant treatment effect (OR = 1.09, 95\% CI 0.98 to 1.21, P = 0.096). Ordinal analysis with proportional odds regression or sliding dichotomy showed highly statistically significant treatment effects (OR 1.15, 95\% CI 1.06 to 1.25, P = 0.0007 and 1.19, 95\% CI 1.08 to 1.30, P = 0.0002), with 2.05-fold and 2.56-fold higher information density compared to the dichotomous approach respectively. Conclusions: Analysis of the CRASH trial data confirmed that ordinal analysis of outcome substantially increases statistical power. We expect these results to hold for other fields of critical care medicine that use ordinal outcome measures and recommend that future trials adopt ordinal analyses. This will permit detection of smaller treatment effects.},

Methods: In this prospective observational study, mortality and poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale 3-6) were analyzed in 311 patients with aSAH at 3-month, 1year, and 5-year follow-up. Sensitivity analysis was performed according to treatment D modality. In-hospital and 5-year complications were analyzed. E Results: Of 476 consecutive patients with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage, 347 patients (72.9\%) had aSAH. Of these, 311 (89.6\%) were treated (242 T endovascular, 69 neurosurgical), with a mean follow-up of 43.4 months (range, 1 to 145). Three-month, 1-year, and 5-year mortality was 18.4\%, 22.9\%, and 29.0\%, and P poor outcome was observed in 42.3\%, 36.0\%, and 36.0\%, respectively. Adjusted poor outcome was lower in endovascular than in neurosurgical treatment at 3 months, with E an absolute difference of 15.8\%, and at 1 year, with an absolute difference of 15.9\%. In both groups, Number Needed to Treat was 6.3. Odds ratios (OR) were 0.36 [95\%CI C 0.18-0.74] for endovascular and 0.40 [95\%CI 0.20-0.81] for neurosurgical treatment. Complications did not differ between the two procedures. However, mechanical C ventilation was less frequent with the endovascular technique (OR=0.67 [95\%CI 0.54A 0.84)]. Conclusions: Patients with aSAH treated according to current guidelines had a shortterm mortality of 18.4\% and 5-year mortality of 29\%. The majority (64.0\%) of patients remained alive without disabilities at 5-year follow-up. Patients prioritized to endovascular treatment had better outcomes than those referred to neurosurgery because endovascular coiling was not feasible.},

  abstract = {Introduction               Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and severe prolonged disability. Intracranial hypertension (ICH) is a critical risk factor of bad outcomes after TBI. Continuous infusion of hyperosmolar therapy has been proposed for the prevention and the treatment of ICH. Whether an early administration of continuous hyperosmolar therapy improves long-term outcomes of patients with TBI is uncertain. The aim of the COBI study (number clinicaltrial.gov 03143751, pre-results stage) is to assess the efficiency and the safety of continuous hyperosmolar therapy in patients with TBI.                                         Methods and analysis               The COBI (COntinuous hyperosmolar therapy in traumatic Brain-Injured patients) trial is a multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label, two-arms study with blinded adjudication of primary outcome. Three hundred and seventy patients hospitalised in intensive care unit with a TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale {$\leq$}12\,and abnormal brain CT scan) are randomised in the first 24\,hours following trauma to standard care or continuous hyperosmolar therapy (20\% NaCl) plus standard care. Continuous hyperosmolar therapy is maintained for at least 48\,hours in the treatment group and continued for as long as is necessary to prevent ICH. The primary outcome is the score on the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale at 6 months. The treatment effect is estimated with ordinal logistic regression adjusted for prespecified prognostic factors and expressed as a common OR.                                         Ethics and dissemination               The COBI trial protocol has been approved by the ethics committee of Paris Ile de France VIII and will be carried out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The results of this study will be disseminated through presentation at scientific conferences and publication in peer-reviewed journals. The COBI trial is the first randomised controlled trial powered to investigate whether continuous hyperosmolar therapy in patients with TBI improve long-term recovery.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter randomized clinical trial conducted in 9 intensive care units in France, including 370 patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who were recruited from October 2017 to August 2019. Follow-up was completed in February 2020. INTERVENTIONS Adult patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury were randomly assigned to receive continuous infusion of 20\% hypertonic saline solution plus standard care (n = 185) or standard care alone (controls; n = 185). The 20\% hypertonic saline solution was administered for 48 hours or longer if patients remained at risk of intracranial hypertension. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) score (range, 1-8, with lower scores indicating worse functional outcome) at 6 months, obtained centrally by blinded assessors and analyzed with ordinal logistic regression adjusted for prespecified prognostic factors (with a common odds ratio [OR] {$>$}1.0 favoring intervention). There were 12 secondary outcomes measured at multiple time points, including development of intracranial hypertension and 6-month mortality. RESULTS Among 370 patients who were randomized (median age, 44 [interquartile range, 27-59] years; 77 [20.2\%] women), 359 (97\%) completed the trial. The adjusted common OR for the GOS-E score at 6 months was 1.02 (95\% CI, 0.71-1.47; P = .92). Of the 12 secondary outcomes, 10 were not significantly different. Intracranial hypertension developed in 62 (33.7\%) patients in the intervention group and 66 (36.3\%) patients in the control group (absolute difference, -2.6\% [95\% CI, -12.3\% to 7.2\%]; OR, 0.80 [95\% CI, 0.51-1.26]). There was no significant difference in 6-month mortality (29 [15.9\%] in the intervention group vs 37 [20.8\%] in the control group; absolute difference, -4.9\% [95\% CI, -12.8\% to 3.1\%]; hazard ratio, 0.79 [95\% CI, 0.48-1.28]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury, treatment with continuous infusion of 20\% hypertonic saline compared with standard care did not result in a significantly better neurological status at 6 months. However, confidence intervals for the findings were wide, and the study may have had limited power to detect a clinically important difference.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Patients with refractory hypercholesterolemia, who have high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels despite treatment with lipid-lowering therapies at maximum tolerated doses, have an increased risk of atherosclerosis. In such patients, the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous and intravenous evinacumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against angiopoietin-like 3, are not known. METHODS In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial, we enrolled patients with or without heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia who had refractory hypercholesterolemia, with a screening LDL cholesterol level of 70 mg per deciliter or higher with atherosclerosis or of 100 mg per deciliter or higher without atherosclerosis. Patients were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous or intravenous evinacumab or placebo. The primary end point was the percent change from baseline in the LDL cholesterol level at week 16 with evinacumab as compared with placebo. RESULTS In total, 272 patients were randomly assigned to the following groups: subcutaneous evinacumab at a dose of 450 mg weekly (40 patients), 300 mg weekly (43 patients), or 300 mg every 2 weeks (39 patients) or placebo (41 patients); or intravenous evinacumab at a dose of 15 mg per kilogram of body weight every 4 weeks (39 patients) or 5 mg per kilogram every 4 weeks (36 patients) or placebo (34 patients). At week 16, the differences in the least-squares mean change from baseline in the LDL cholesterol level between the groups assigned to receive subcutaneous evinacu\- mab at a dose of 450 mg weekly, 300 mg weekly, and 300 mg every 2 weeks and the placebo group were -56.0, -52.9, and -38.5 percentage points, respectively (P{$<$}0.001 for all comparisons).

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To assess whether cEEG is associated with reduced mortality compared with rEEG. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The pragmatic multicenter Continuous EEG Randomized Trial in Adults (CERTA) was conducted between 2017 and 2018, with follow-up of 6 months. Outcomes were assessed by interviewers blinded to interventions.The study took place at 4 tertiary hospitals in Switzerland (intensive and intermediate care units). Depending on investigators' availability, we pragmatically recruited critically ill adults having Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 11 or less or Full Outline of Responsiveness score of 12 or less, without recent seizures or status epilepticus. They had cerebral (eg, brain trauma, cardiac arrest, hemorrhage, or stroke) or noncerebral conditions (eg, toxic-metabolic or unknown etiology), and EEG was requested as part of standard care. An independent physician provided emergency informed consent. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized 1:1 to cEEG for 30 to 48 hours vs 2 rEEGs (20 minutes each), interpreted according to standardized American Clinical Neurophysiology Society guidelines. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mortality at 6 months represented the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included interictal and ictal features detection and change in therapy. RESULTS We analyzed 364 patients (33\% women; mean [SD] age, 63 [15] years). At 6 months, mortality was 89 of 182 in those with cEEG and 88 of 182 in those with rEEG (adjusted relative risk [RR], 1.02; 95\% CI, 0.83-1.26; P = .85). Exploratory comparisons within subgroups stratifying patients according to age, premorbid disability, comorbidities on admission, deeper consciousness reduction, and underlying diagnoses revealed no significant effect modification. Continuous EEG was associated with increased detection of interictal features and seizures (adjusted RR, 1.26; 95\% CI, 1.08-1.15; P = .004 and 3.37; 95\% CI, 1.63-7.00; P = .001, respectively) and more frequent adaptations in antiseizure therapy (RR, 1.84; 95\% CI, 1.12-3.00; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This pragmatic trial shows that in critically ill adults with impaired consciousness and no recent seizure, cEEG leads to increased seizure detection and modification of antiseizure treatment but is not related to improved outcome compared with repeated rEEG. Pending larger studies, rEEG may represent a valid alternative to cEEG in centers with limited resources.},

  abstract = {Summary: Continuous video-EEG is recommended for patients with altered consciousness; as compared to routine EEG (lasting ,30 minutes), it improves seizure detection, but is time- and resource-consuming. Although North American centers increasingly implement continuous video-EEG, most other (including European) hospitals have insufficient resources. Only one study suggested that continuous video-EEG could improve outcome in adults, and a recent assessments challenge this view. This article reviews current evidence on the added value for continuous video-EEG in clinical terms and describes a design for a prospective study. In a multicenter randomized clinical trial (NCT03129438), adults with a Glasgow Coma Scale \#11 will be randomized 1:1 to continuous video-EEG (cEEG) for 30 to 48 hours or 2 routine EEG (rEEG), assessed through standardized American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS) guidelines. The primary outcome will be mortality at 6 months, assessed blindly. Secondary outcomes will explore functional status at 4 weeks and 6 months, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, infection rates, and hospitalization costs. Using a 2-sided approach with power of 0.8 and a error of 0.05, 2 {$\cdot$} 174 patients are needed to detect an absolute survival difference of 14\%, suggested by the single available study on the topic. This study should help clarifying whether cEEG has a significant impact on outcome and define its cost effectiveness. If the trial will result positive, it will encourage broader implementation of cEEG with consecutive substantial impact on health care and resource allocations. If not, it may offer a rationale to design a larger trial, anddleast for smaller centersdto avoid widespread implementation of cEEG, rationalizing personnel and device costs.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most fatal and disabling stroke subtype. Widely used tools for prediction of mortality are fundamentally limited in that they do not account for effects of withdrawal of care and are not designed to predict functional recovery. We developed an acute clinical score to predict likelihood of functional independence. Methods\textemdash We prospectively characterized 629 consecutive patients with ICH at hospital presentation. Predictors of functional independence (Glasgow Outcome Score Ն4) at 90 days were used to develop a logistic regression-based risk stratification scale in a random subset of two thirds and validated in the remaining one third of the cohort. Results\textemdash At 90 days, 162 (26\%) patients achieved independence. Age, Glasgow Coma Scale, ICH location, volume (all PϽ0.0001), and pre-ICH cognitive impairment (Pϭ0.005) were independently associated with Glasgow Outcome Score Ն4. The FUNC score was developed as a sum of individual points (0 \textendash 11) based on strength of association with outcome. In both the development and validation cohorts, the proportion of patients who achieved Glasgow Outcome Score Ն4 increased steadily with FUNC score. No patient assigned a FUNC score Յ4 achieved functional independence, whereas Ͼ80\% with a score of 11 did. The predictive accuracy of the FUNC score remained unchanged when restricted to ICH survivors only, consistent with absence of confounding by early withdrawal of care. Conclusions\textemdash FUNC score is a valid clinical assessment tool that identifies patients with ICH who will attain functional independence and thus, can provide guidance in clinical decision-making and patient selection for clinical trials.

The pathological mechanisms underlying DCI are still unclear and the calcium channel blocker nimodipine remains the only therapeutic intervention proven to improve functional outcomes after SAH. The recent failure of the drug clazosentan to improve functional outcomes despite reducing vasoconstriction has moved the focus of research into DCI away from cerebral artery constriction towards a more multifactorial aetiology. Novel pathological mechanisms have been suggested, including damage to cerebral tissue in the first 72 h after aneurysm rupture (`early brain injury'), cortical spreading depression, and microthrombosis. A greater understanding of the significance of these pathophysiological mechanisms and potential genetic risk factors is required, if new approaches to the prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of DCI are to be developed. Furthermore, objective and reliable biomarkers are needed for the diagnosis of DCI in poor grade SAH patients requiring sedation and to assess the efficacy of new therapeutic interventions. The purpose of this article is to appraise these recent advances in research into DCI, relate them to current clinical practice, and suggest potential novel avenues for future research.},

In addition, the use of a data-derived `optimal' cutpoint leads to serious bias. We illustrate the impact of dichotomization of continuous predictor variables using as a detailed case study a randomized trial in primary biliary cirrhosis.

We explored ICH surrogate satisfaction with decision making and experience of decision regret using validated measures in a prospective multicenter study. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} Cases of non-traumatic ICH were enrolled from three hospitals (September 2015\textendash December 2016), and surrogate decision makers were invited to complete a self-administered survey. The primary outcome was the 10-item decision-making subscale of the Family Satisfaction in the Intensive Care Unit scale (FSICU-DM, range 0\textendash 100, higher is greater satisfaction), and the secondary outcome was the decision regret scale (range 0\textendash 100, higher is greater regret). Linear regression models were used to assess the association between satisfaction with decision making and prespecified covariates using manual backward selection. Results:\hspace{0.6em} A total of 73 surrogates were approached for participation (in person or mail), with 48 surrogates returning a completed survey (median surrogate age 60.5 years, 63\% female, 77\% white). Patients had a median age of 72.5, 54\% were female, with a median admission Glasgow coma scale of 10, in-hospital mortality of 31\%, and 56\% with an in-hospital DNR order. Physicians commonly made treatment recommendation ({$>$}\,50\%) regarding brain surgery or transitions to comfort measures, but rarely made recommendations ({$<$}\,20\%) regarding DNR orders. Surrogate satisfaction with decision making was generally high (median FSICU-DM 85, IQR 57.5\textendash 95). Factors associated with higher satisfaction on multivariable analysis included greater use of shared decision making (P\,{$<$}\,0.0001), younger patient age (p\,=\,0.02), ICH score of 3 or higher (p\,=\,0.03), and surrogate relationship (spouse vs. other, p\,=\,0.02). Timing of DNR orders was not associated with satisfaction (P\,{$>$}\,0.25). Decision regret scores were generally low (median 12.5, IQR 0\textendash 31.3). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Considering the severity and abruptness of ICH, it is reassuring that surrogate satisfaction with decision making was generally high and regret was generally low. However, more work is needed to define the appropriate outcome measures and optimal methods of recruitment for studies of surrogate decision makers of ICH patients.},

The authors used an alternating treatment protocol to compare the effect of hypertonic saline with that of mannitol given for episodes of increased intracranial pressure in patients treated for severe head injury at their hospital during 2006\textendash 2008. Standard guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury were followed. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) was treated either with mannitol or hypertonic saline. Doses of similar osmotic burden (mannitol 20\%, 2 ml/kg, infused over 20 minutes, or saline 15\%, 0.42 ml/kg, administered as a bolus via a central venous catheter) were given alternately to the individual patient with severe brain injury during episodes of increased pressure. The dependent variables were the extent and duration of reduction of increased ICP. The choice of agent for treatment of the initial hypertensive event was determined on a randomized basis; treatment was alternated for every subsequent event in each individual patient. Reduction of ICP and duration of action were recorded after each event. Results obtained after mannitol administration were statistically compared with those obtained after hypertonic saline administration. Results. Data pertaining to 199 hypertensive events in 29 patients were collected. The mean decrease in ICP obtained with mannitol was 7.96 mm Hg and that obtained with hypertonic saline was 8.43 mm Hg (p = 0.586, equal variances assumed). The mean duration of effect was 3 hours 33 minutes for mannitol and 4 hours 17 minutes for hypertonic saline (p = 0.40, equal variances assumed). Conclusions. No difference between the 2 medications could be found with respect to the extent of reduction of ICP or duration of action. (DOI: 10.3171/2010.5.JNS091685)},

  abstract = {Background: Osmotic agents are widely used to lower elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). However, little data are available regarding cerebral oxygenation and metabolism in the traumatized brains studied under clinical conditions. The present prospective, open-labeled clinical study was designed to investigate whether administration of mannitol, with the aim of reducing moderate intracranial hypertension, improves cerebral metabolism and oxygenation in patients after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: Multimodal cerebral monitoring (MCM), consisting of intraparenchymal ICP, tissue oxygenation (ptiO2), and micro dialysis measurements was initiated in six male TBI patients (mean age 45 years; Glasgow Coma Scale score {$<$}9). A total of 14 mannitol boli (20\%, 0.5g/kg, 20 minutes infusion time) were administered to treat ICP exceeding 20 mm Hg (2.7 kPa). Temporal alterations determined by MCM after mannitol infusions were recorded for 120 minutes. Microdialysates were assayed immediately for extracellular glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and glutamate concentrations. Results: Elevated ICP was successfully treated in all cases. This effect was maximal 40 minutes after start of infusion (25 ؎ 6 mm Hg [3.3 ؎ 0.8 kPa] to 17 ؎ 3 mm Hg [2.3 ؎ 0.4 kPa], p {$<$} 0.05) and lasted up to 100 minutes. Cerebral ptiO2 remained unaffected (21 ؎ 5 mm Hg [2.8 ؎ 0.7 kPa] to 23 ؎ 6 mm Hg [3.1 ؎ 0.8 kPa], n.s.). Microdialysate concentrations of all analytes rose unspecifically by 10\% to 40\% from baseline, reaching maximum concentrations 40 to 60 minutes after start of the infusion. Conclusions: Mannitol efficiently reduces increased ICP. At an ICP of up to 30 mm Hg [4 kPa] it does not affect cerebral oxygenation. Unspecific increases of extracellular fluid metabolites can be explained by transient osmotic dehydration. Additional mechanisms, such as increased cerebral perfusion and blood volume, might explain an accelerated return to baseline.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hematoma volume and impaired level of consciousness are the most potent predictors of outcome after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The effect of preceding aspirin-use on outcome after ICH is poorly investigated. We investigated short-term mortality and hematoma enlargement in subjects with ICH to find the predictors for these outcomes. METHODS: This population-based study included all subjects with ICH during a period of 33 months in the population of Northern Ostrobothnia, Finland. The subjects were identified, and their clinical characteristics and outcomes were checked from hospital records or death records. RESULTS: Three-month mortality of the 208 identified subjects with ICH was 33\%. The independent risk factors for death were regular aspirin-use at the onset of ICH (relative risks [RR], 2.5; 95\% CI, 1.3 to 4.6; P=0.004), warfarin-use at the onset of ICH (RR, 3.2; 95\% CI, 1.6 to 6.1; P=0.001), and ICH score higher than 2 on admission (RR, 13.8; 95\% CI, 6.0 to 31.4; P{$<$}0.001). Regular aspirin-use preceding the onset of ICH associated significantly with hematoma enlargement during the first week after ICH (P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: We observed poor short-term outcomes and increased mortality, probably attributable to rapid enlargement of hematomas, in the subjects with ICH who had been taking regularly moderate doses of aspirin (median 250 mg) immediately before the onset of the stroke.},

Methods:\hspace{0.6em} PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (January 2013\textendash April 2020) were searched. Sensitivity and false-positive rate (FPR) for each predictor were calculated. Due to heterogeneities in recording times, predictor thresholds, and definition of some predictors, meta-analysis was not performed. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Ninety-four studies (30,200 patients) were included. Bilaterally absent pupillary or corneal reflexes after day 4 from ROSC, high blood values of neuron-specific enolase from 24 h after ROSC, absent N20 waves of short-latency somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEPs) or unequivocal seizures on electroencephalogram (EEG) from the day of ROSC, EEG background suppression or burst-suppression from 24 h after ROSC, diffuse cerebral oedema on brain CT from 2 h after ROSC, or reduced diffusion on brain MRI at 2\textendash 5 days after ROSC had 0\% FPR for poor outcome in most studies. Risk of bias assessed using the QUIPS tool was high for all predictors. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} In comatose resuscitated patients, clinical, biochemical, neurophysiological, and radiological tests have a potential to predict poor neurological outcome with no false-positive predictions within the first week after CA. Guidelines should consider the methodological concerns and limited sensitivity for individual modalities. (PROSPERO CRD42019141169)},

The Swiss SOS (Swiss Study on Subarachnoid Hemorrhage) was established in 2008 and offers the unique opportunity to provide this data from the point of care on a nationwide level. METHODS: All patients with confirmed aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage admitted between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2014, within Switzerland were recorded in a prospective registry. Incidence rates were calculated based on time-matched population data. Admission parameters and outcomes at discharge and at 1 year were recorded. RESULTS: We recorded data of 1787 consecutive patients. The incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in Switzerland was 3.7 per 100\,000 persons/y. The number of female patients was 1170 (65.5\%). With a follow-up rate of 91.3\% at 1 year, 1042 patients (58.8\%) led an independent life according to the modified Rankin Scale (0\textendash 2). About 1 in 10 patients survived in a dependent state (modified Rankin Scale, 3\textendash 5; n=185; 10.4\%). Case fatality was 20.1\% (n=356) at discharge and 22.1\% (n=391) after 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: The current incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in Switzerland is lower than expected and an indication of a global trend toward decreasing admissions for ruptured intracranial aneurysms.},

The increasingly shortened timeframes in which administration of antibiotics is recommended, have forced physicians to sacrifice diagnostic accuracy for speed, encouraging the overuse of antibiotics. The evidence supporting this practice is based on retrospective data, with all the limitations attached, while the only randomized trial on this subject does not show a mortality benefit from early administration of antibiotics in a population of patients with sepsis as often seen in the emergency department (ED). Physicians are challenged to treat patients suspected of having sepsis within a short period of time, while the real challenge should be to identify patients who would not be harmed by withholding treatment with antibiotics until the diagnosis of infection with a bacterial origin is confirmed and the appropriateness of a course of antibiotics can be evaluated more adequately. Therefore, in the general population of patients with sepsis, taking the time to gather additional data to confirm the diagnosis should be encouraged without a specific timeframe, although physicians should be encouraged to perform an adequate work-up as soon as possible. Patients with suspected sepsis and signs of shock should immediately be treated with antibiotics, as there is no margin for error.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in the intensive care unit (ICU) are treated with supplemental oxygen, but the benefits and harms of different oxygenation targets are unclear. We hypothesized that using a lower target for partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao2) would result in lower mortality than using a higher target. METHODS In this multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 2928 adult patients who had recently been admitted to the ICU ({$\leq$}12 hours before randomization) and who were receiving at least 10 liters of oxygen per minute in an open system or had a fraction of inspired oxygen of at least 0.50 in a closed system to receive oxygen therapy targeting a Pao2 of either 60 mm Hg (lower-oxygenation group) or 90 mm Hg (higheroxygenation group) for a maximum of 90 days. The primary outcome was death within 90 days. RESULTS At 90 days, 618 of 1441 patients (42.9\%) in the lower-oxygenation group and 613 of 1447 patients (42.4\%) in the higher-oxygenation group had died (adjusted risk ratio, 1.02; 95\% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.11; P\,=\,0.64). At 90 days, there was no significant between-group difference in the percentage of days that patients were alive without life support or in the percentage of days they were alive after hospital discharge. The percentages of patients who had new episodes of shock, myocardial ischemia, ischemic stroke, or intestinal ischemia were similar in the two groups (P\,=\,0.24).

It remains however unclear how to obtain valid bootstrap inference when dealing with multiple imputation to address missing data. We present four methods which are intuitively appealing, easy to implement, and combine bootstrap estimation with multiple imputation. We show that three of the four approaches yield valid inference, but that the performance of the methods varies with respect to the number of imputed data sets and the extent of missingness. Simulation studies reveal the behavior of our approaches in finite samples. A topical analysis from HIV treatment research, which determines the optimal timing of antiretroviral treatment initiation in young children, demonstrates the practical implications of the four methods in a sophisticated and realistic setting. This analysis suffers from missing data and uses the \$g\$-formula for inference, a method for which no standard errors are available.},

Objective: The goal of this study was to explore how family members, nurses, and physicians experience the palliative and supportive care needs of patients with SABI receiving care in the neuroscience intensive care unit (neuro-ICU). Design: Semistructured interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Setting/Subjects: Thirty-bed neuro-ICU in a regional comprehensive stroke and level-one trauma center in the United States. We completed 47 interviews regarding 15 patients with family members (n = 16), nurses (n = 15), and physicians (n = 16). Results: Two themes were identified: (1) hope and (2) personhood. (1) Families linked prognostic uncertainty to a need for hope and expressed a desire for physicians to acknowledge this relationship. The language of hope varied depending on the participant: clinicians used hope as an object that can be given or taken away, generally in the process of conveying prognosis, while families expressed hope as an action that supported coping with their loved one's acute illness and its prognostic uncertainty. (2) Participants described the loss of personhood through brain injury, the need to recognize and treat the brain-injured patient as a person, and the importance of relatedness and connection, including personal support of families by clinicians. Conclusions: Support for hope and preservation of personhood challenge care in the neuro-ICU as identified by families and clinicians of patients with SABI. Specific practical approaches can address these challenges and improve the palliative care provided to patients and families in the neuro-ICU.},

  pages = {10},
  abstract = {Hypoxic ischemic brain injury (HIBI) after cardiac arrest (CA) is a leading cause of mortality and long-term neurologic disability in survivors. The pathophysiology of HIBI encompasses a heterogeneous cascade that culminates in secondary brain injury and neuronal cell death. This begins with primary injury to the brain caused by the immediate cessation of cerebral blood flow following CA. Thereafter, the secondary injury of HIBI takes place in the hours and days following the initial CA and reperfusion. Among factors that may be implicated in this secondary injury include reperfusion injury, microcirculatory dysfunction, impaired cerebral autoregulation, hypoxemia, hyperoxia, hyperthermia, fluctuations in arterial carbon dioxide, and concomitant anemia. Clarifying the underlying pathophysiology of HIBI is imperative and has been the focus of considerable research to identify therapeutic targets. Most notably, targeted temperature management has been studied rigorously in preventing secondary injury after HIBI and is associated with improved outcome compared with hyperthermia. Recent advances point to important roles of anemia, carbon dioxide perturbations, hypoxemia, hyperoxia, and cerebral edema as contributing to secondary injury after HIBI and adverse outcomes. Furthermore, breakthroughs in the individualization of perfusion targets for patients with HIBI using cerebral autoregulation monitoring represent an attractive area of future work with therapeutic implications. We provide an in-depth review of the pathophysiology of HIBI to critically evaluate current approaches for the early treatment of HIBI secondary to CA. Potential therapeutic targets and future research directions are summarized.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether hydroxychloroquine is an efficacious treatment for adults hospitalized with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a multicenter, blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial conducted at 34 hospitals in the US. Adults hospitalized with respiratory symptoms from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were enrolled between April 2 and June 19, 2020, with the last outcome assessment on July 17, 2020. The planned sample size was 510 patients, with interim analyses planned after every 102 patients were enrolled. The trial was stopped at the fourth interim analysis for futility with a sample size of 479 patients. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice daily for 2 doses, then 200 mg twice daily for 8 doses) (n = 242) or placebo (n = 237). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was clinical status 14 days after randomization as assessed with a 7-category ordinal scale ranging from 1 (death) to 7 (discharged from the hospital and able to perform normal activities). The primary outcome was analyzed with a multivariable proportional odds model, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) greater than 1.0 indicating more favorable outcomes with hydroxychloroquine than placebo. The trial included 12 secondary outcomes, including 28-day mortality. RESULTS Among 479 patients who were randomized (median age, 57 years; 44.3\% female; 37.2\% Hispanic/Latinx; 23.4\% Black; 20.1\% in the intensive care unit; 46.8\% receiving supplemental oxygen without positive pressure; 11.5\% receiving noninvasive ventilation or nasal high-flow oxygen; and 6.7\% receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), 433 (90.4\%) completed the primary outcome assessment at 14 days and the remainder had clinical status imputed. The median duration of symptoms prior to randomization was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 3 to 7 days). Clinical status on the ordinal outcome scale at 14 days did not significantly differ between the hydroxychloroquine and placebo groups (median [IQR] score, 6 [4-7] vs 6 [4-7]; aOR, 1.02 [95\% CI, 0.73 to 1.42]). None of the 12 secondary outcomes were significantly different between groups. At 28 days after randomization, 25 of 241 patients (10.4\%) in the hydroxychloroquine group and 25 of 236 (10.6\%) in the placebo group had died (absolute difference, -0.2\% [95\% CI, -5.7\% to 5.3\%]; aOR, 1.07 [95\% CI, 0.54 to 2.09]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults hospitalized with respiratory illness from COVID-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, compared with placebo, did not significantly improve clinical status at day 14. These findings do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 among hospitalized adults.},

  abstract = {Objective: As common prognostication models in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are developed variably including patients with early (,24 hours) care limitations (ECL), we investigated its interaction with prognostication in maximally treated patients and sought to provide a new unbiased severity assessment tool. Methods: This observational cohort study analyzed consecutive ICH patients (n 5 583) from a prospective registry over 5 years. We characterized the influence of ECL on overall outcome by propensity score matching and on conventional prognostication using receiver operating characteristic analyses. We established the max-ICH score based on independent predictors of 12month functional outcome in maximally treated patients and compared it to existing models. Results: Prevalence of ECL was 19.2\% (n 5 112/583) and all of these patients died. Yet propensity score matching displayed that 50.7\% (n 5 35/69) theoretically could have survived, with 18.8\% (n 5 13/69) possibly reaching favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0\textendash 3). Conventional prognostication seemed to be confounded by ECL, documented by a decreased predictive validity (area under the curve [AUC] 0.67, confidence interval [CI] 0.61\textendash 0.73 vs AUC 0.80, CI 0.76\textendash 0.83; p , 0.01), overestimating poor outcome (mortality by 44.8\%, unfavorable outcome by 10.1\%) in maximally treated patients. In these patients, the novel max-ICH score (0\textendash 10) integrates strength-adjusted predictors, i.e., NIH Stroke Scale score, age, intraventricular hemorrhage, anticoagulation, and ICH volume (lobar and nonlobar), demonstrating improved predictive accuracy for functional outcome (12 months: AUC 0.81, CI 0.77\textendash 0.85; p , 0.01). The max-ICH score may more accurately delineate potentials of aggressive care, showing favorable outcome in 45.4\% (n 5 214/471) and a long-term mortality rate of only 30.1\% (n 5 142/471). Conclusions: Care limitations significantly influenced the validity of common prognostication models resulting in overestimation of poor outcome. The max-ICH score demonstrated increased predictive validity with minimized confounding by care limitations, making it a useful tool for severity assessment in ICH patients.

Nevertheless, claims continue to be made that analysis of covariance is biased if the groups are not equal at baseline. If the required equality were in expectation only, this would permit the use of ANCOVA in randomized clinical trials but not in observational studies. The discussion is related to Lord's paradox. In this note, it is shown, however that it is not a necessary condition for groups to be equal at baseline, not even in expectation, for ANCOVA to provide unbiased estimates of treatment effects. It is also shown that although many situations can be envisaged where ANCOVA is biased it is very difficult to imagine circumstances under which SACS would then be unbiased and a causal interpretation could be made.

Two controversies involving Fisher in the 1930s are discussed: one with Neyman concerning additivity and the other with Student concerning randomization. Their relevance today is considered, as is whether randomization inference in clinical trials is dead and whether modelling rules the day, whether minimization is an acceptable procedure and to what extent trialists confuse experiments with surveys. It will be maintained that a number of di erent possible purposes of clinical trials have been confused because in the case of the general linear model, under strong additivity, they can all be satis\"yed by a single analysis.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of endovascular therapy (EVT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke who have large vessel occlusion has rapidly increased in the United States following pivotal trials demonstrating its benefit. Information about the contribution of interhospital transfer in improving access to EVT will help organize regional systems of stroke care. METHODS: We analyzed trends of transfer-in EVT from a cohort of 1\,863\,693 patients with ischemic stroke admitted to 2143 Get With The GuidelinesStroke participating hospitals between January 2012 and December 2017. We further examined the association between arrival mode and in-hospital outcomes by using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: Of the 37\,260 patients who received EVT at 639 hospitals during the study period, 42.9\% (15\,975) arrived at the EVT-providing hospital after interhospital transfer. Transfer-in EVT cases increased from 256 in the first quarter 2012 to 1422 in the fourth quarter 2017, with sharply accelerated increases following the fourth quarter 2014 (P{$<$}0.001 for change in linear trend). Transfer-in patients were younger and more likely to be of white race, to arrive during off-hours, and to be treated at comprehensive stroke centers. Transfer-in patients had significantly longer last-known-well-to-EVT initiation time (median, 289 minutes versus 213 minutes; absolute standardized difference, 67.33) but were more likely to have door-to-EVT initiation time of {$\leq$}90 minutes (65.6\% versus 23.6\%; absolute standardized difference, 93.18). In-hospital outcomes were worse for transfer-in patients undergoing EVT in unadjusted and in risk-adjusted models. Although the difference in in-hospital mortality disappeared after adjusting for delay in EVT initiation (14.7\% versus 13.4\%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.01; 95\% CI, 0.92\textendash 1.11), transfer-in patients were still more likely to develop symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (7.0\% versus 5.7\%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.15; 95\% CI, 1.02\textendash 1.29) and less likely to have either independent ambulation at discharge (33.1\% versus 37.1\%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.80\textendash 0.95) or to be discharged to home (24.3\% versus 29.1\%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.76\textendash 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Interhospital transfer for EVT is increasingly common and is associated with a significant delay in EVT initiation highlighting the need to develop more efficient stroke systems of care. Further evaluation to identify factors that impact EVT outcomes for transfer-in patients is warranted.},

Additionally, much of this research only speculates on variable associations, leaving prospective randomized clinical trials as the sole purveyors of claims about causal relations between variables. There has been a growing movement of causal inference that uses new techniques to investigate causality using observational data. These techniques include the implementation of directed acyclic graphs, which allow researchers to explicitly and reproducibly define the causal relationships between study variables, thus making statistical analysis more robust. Directed acyclic graphs further allow researchers to identify confounding and other sources of bias and to discover causal effects among complex networks of variables.

E Results: Of 476 consecutive patients with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage, 347 patients (72.9\%) had aSAH. Of these, 311 (89.6\%) were treated (242 T endovascular, 69 neurosurgical), with a mean follow-up of 43.4 months (range, 1 to 145). Three-month, 1-year, and 5-year mortality was 18.4\%, 22.9\%, and 29.0\%, and P poor outcome was observed in 42.3\%, 36.0\%, and 36.0\%, respectively. Adjusted poor outcome was lower in endovascular than in neurosurgical treatment at 3 months, with E an absolute difference of 15.8\%, and at 1 year, with an absolute difference of 15.9\%. In both groups, Number Needed to Treat was 6.3. Odds ratios (OR) were 0.36 [95\%CI C 0.18-0.74] for endovascular and 0.40 [95\%CI 0.20-0.81] for neurosurgical treatment. Complications did not differ between the two procedures. However, mechanical C ventilation was less frequent with the endovascular technique (OR=0.67 [95\%CI 0.54A 0.84)]. Conclusions: Patients with aSAH treated according to current guidelines had a shortterm mortality of 18.4\% and 5-year mortality of 29\%. The majority (64.0\%) of patients remained alive without disabilities at 5-year follow-up. Patients prioritized to endovascular treatment had better outcomes than those referred to neurosurgery because endovascular coiling was not feasible.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Nonconvulsive seizures (NCSs) are common in critically ill adult patients with acute neurologic conditions. However, the effect of NCSs on patient outcome remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of NCSs on short-term outcome and to assess the clinical and EEG factors associated with NCSs. Methods: We retrospectively identified 219 adult patients from the EEG reporting system who underwent continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring between January 2018 and June 2018. Patients with anoxic brain injury were excluded from the study. Clinical, laboratory, and EEG data were reviewed to determine potentially predictive factors of NCSs. The impact of NCSs on inhospital mortality, length of stay, and disability on discharge was measured; an modified Rankin scale of three or greater was considered disabled. Results: Of the 219 patients included in our study, a total of 14\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 31) had NCSs on continuous EEG, of which 42\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 13) had their first seizure discharge recorded during the first hour of continuous EEG monitoring. The presence of clinical seizures before continuous EEG (odds ratio {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.787; 95\% confidence interval {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.197\textendash 2.667, P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.0045), history of epilepsy (odds ratio {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.508; 95\% confidence interval {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.027\textendash 2.215, P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.035), and comatose state (29 vs. 16\%; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.0006) were associated with NCSs. Among EEG characteristics, the presence of interictal epileptiform discharges (P , 0.0001), lateralized rhythmic delta activity (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.02), and lateralized periodic discharges (P , 0.0001) were associated with NCSs. Nonconvulsive seizures were significantly associated with longer in-hospital stay (23.68 6 24.84 vs. 17.14 6 20.52; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.036) and disability on discharge (87\% [n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 27] vs. 13\% [n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 4], P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.02). However, there was no significant association between NCS and in-hospital mortality (9.6\% [n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 3] vs. 10.6\% [n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 20]; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.1). Conclusions: Nonconvulsive seizures are associated with longer in-hospital stay and disability on discharge but not with inhospital mortality in adult patients.},

DESIGN: A post hoc analysis of the erythropoietin trial in traumatic brain injury (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00987454) including daily data on mannitol and hypertonic saline use. SETTING: Twenty-nine university-affiliated teaching hospitals in seven countries. PATIENTS: A total of 568 patients treated in the ICU for 48 hours without acute kidney injury of whom 43 (7\%) received mannitol and 170 (29\%) hypertonic saline. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We categorized acute kidney injury stage according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome classification and defined acute kidney injury as any Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome stage-based changes from the admission creatinine. We tested associations between early (first 2 d) mannitol and hypertonic saline and time to acute kidney injury up to ICU discharge and death up to 180 days with Cox regression analysis. Subsequently, acute kidney injury developed more often in patients receiving mannitol (35\% vs 10\%; p {$<$} 0.001) and hypertonic saline (23\% vs 10\%; p {$<$} 0.001). On competing risk analysis including factors associated with acute kidney injury, mannitol (hazard ratio, 2.3; 95\% CI, 1.2\textendash 4.3; p = 0.01), but not hypertonic saline (hazard ratio, 1.6; 95\% CI, 0.9\textendash 2.8; p = 0.08), was independently associated with time to acute kidney injury. In a Cox model for predicting time to death, both the use of mannitol (hazard ratio, 2.1; 95\% CI, 1.1\textendash 4.1; p = 0.03) and hypertonic saline (hazard ratio, 1.8; 95\% CI, 1.02\textendash 3.2; p = 0.04) were associated with time to death. CONCLUSIONS: In this post hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial, the early use of mannitol, but not hypertonic saline, was independently associated with an increase in acute kidney injury. Our findings suggest the need to further evaluate the use and choice of osmotherapy in traumatic brain injury.},

  abstract = {Poor research design and data analysis encourage false-positive findings. Such poor methods persist despite perennial calls for improvement, suggesting that they result from something more than just misunderstanding. The persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favour them, leading to the natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no conscious strategizing\textemdash no deliberate cheating nor loafing\textemdash by scientists, only that publication is a principal factor for career advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and computational modelling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioural sciences and show that power has not improved despite repeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To demonstrate the logical consequences of structural incentives, we then present a dynamic model of scientific communities in which competing laboratories investigate novel or previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more `progeny,' such that their methods are more often copied and their students are more likely to start labs of their own. Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and increasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show that replication slows but does not stop the process of methodological deterioration. Improving the quality of research requires change at the institutional level.},

  abstract = {Introduction               Delirium in critically ill adults is associated with prolonged hospital stay, increased mortality and greater cognitive and functional decline. Current practice guideline recommendations advocate the use of non-pharmacological strategies to reduce delirium. The routine use of scheduled haloperidol to treat delirium is not recommended given a lack of evidence regarding its ability to resolve delirium nor improve relevant short-term and longer-term outcomes. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of haloperidol for the treatment of delirium in adult critically ill patients to reduce days spent with coma or delirium.                                         Methods and analysis               EuRIDICE is a prospective, multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Study population consists of adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients without acute neurological injury who have delirium based on a positive Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) or Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) assessment. Intervention is intravenous haloperidol 2.5\,mg (or matching placebo) every 8\,hours, titrated daily based on ICDSC or CAM-ICU positivity to a maximum of 5\,mg every 8\,hours, until delirium resolution or ICU discharge. Main study endpoint is delirium and coma-free days (DCFD) up to 14 days after randomisation. Secondary endpoints include (1) 28-day and 1-year mortality, (2) cognitive and functional performance at 3 and 12 months, (3) patient and family delirium and ICU experience, (4) psychological sequelae during and after ICU stay, (4) safety concerns associated with haloperidol use and (5) cost-effectiveness. Differences in DCFDs between haloperidol and placebo group will be analysed using Poisson regression analysis. Study recruitment started in February 2018 and continues.

  abstract = {Cerebral cortical vein thrombosis (CCVT) is a rare type of cerebral venous thrombosis, which is frequently combined with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). We aimed to compare the difference of clinical features between the isolated and the combined subtypes of CCVT. A literature search was conducted utilizing the PubMed Central and EMBASE databases to identify studies up to Dec 2019. Clinical manifestations, presumable risk factors, imaging modalities, radiological findings, treatment, and prognosis in patients with CCVT were recorded. 335 publications were identified (n\,=\,325, 141 males and 184 females, mean age 40.24\,{$\pm$}\,16.26 years). Headaches (46.8\%), motor/sensory disorders (43.3\%), and seizures (42.5\%) were commonly seen. Pregnancy/postpartum (n\,=\,29), oral contraception use (n\,=\,15), fertility drug use (n\,=\,4) ranked the top three comorbidities of CCVT in female patients, while for general populations, thrombophilia, invasive interventions in the cerebrospinal system, as well as malignancy, would be the common risk factors. MRV and DSA were more likely to confirm diagnosis. More than 30\% of CCVT presented brain lesions, including infarction (6.5\%) and hemorrhage (24.0\%). Isolated CCVT was prone to develop hemorrhagic infarction while combined CCVT was more likely to have ischemic lesions. More than 90\% of the patients acquired good outcomes at discharge or short-term follow-up (within one year). There is a difference between Isolated CCVT and CCVT combined CVST on the sites and types of brain lesions. MRV and DSA may contribute to the final diagnosis.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Population-based global payment gives health care providers a spending target for the care of a defined group of patients. We examined changes in spending, utilization, and quality through 8 years of the Alternative Quality Contract (AQC) of Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) of Massachusetts, a population-based payment model that includes financial rewards and penalties (two-sided risk). METHODS Using a difference-in-differences method to analyze data from 2006 through 2016, we compared spending among enrollees whose physician organizations entered the AQC starting in 2009 with spending among privately insured enrollees in control states. We examined quantities of sentinel services using an analogous approach. We then compared process and outcome quality measures with averages in New England and the United States. N Engl J Med 2019;381:252-63. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMsa1813621 Copyright \textcopyright{} 2019 Massachusetts Medical Society. RESULTS During the 8-year post-intervention period from 2009 to 2016, the increase in the average annual medical spending on claims for the enrollees in organizations that entered the AQC in 2009 was \$461 lower per enrollee than spending in the control states (P{$<$}0.001), an 11.7\% relative savings on claims. Savings on claims were driven in the early years by lower prices and in the later years by lower utilization of services, including use of laboratory testing, certain imaging tests, and emergency department visits. Most quality measures of processes and outcomes improved more in the AQC cohorts than they did in New England and the nation in unadjusted analyses. Savings were generally larger among subpopulations that were enrolled longer. Enrollees of organizations that entered the AQC in 2010, 2011, and 2012 had medical claims savings of 11.9\%, 6.9\%, and 2.3\%, respectively, by 2016. The savings for the 2012 cohort were statistically less precise than those for the other cohorts. In the later years of the initial AQC cohorts and across the years of the later-entry cohorts, the savings on claims exceeded incentive payments, which included quality bonuses and providers' share of the savings below spending targets. CONCLUSIONS During the first 8 years after its introduction, the BCBS population-based payment model was associated with slower growth in medical spending on claims, resulting in savings that over time began to exceed incentive payments. Unadjusted measures of quality under this model were higher than or similar to average regional and national quality measures. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.)},

Since then, the central role of lactate in the definition and management of septic shock has only been expanded and become more ingrained. This review will discuss the wisdom of such an approach, an updated model describing the origins of hyperlactatemia in sepsis, and how such improvements in our knowledge of the underlying physiology should change our approach to resuscitation in patients presenting with septic shock.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy of 5 or 10 days of remdesivir treatment compared with standard care on clinical status on day 11 after initiation of treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, open-label trial of hospitalized patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and moderate COVID-19 pneumonia (pulmonary infiltrates and room-air oxygen saturation {$>$}94\%) enrolled from March 15 through April 18, 2020, at 105 hospitals in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The date of final follow-up was May 20, 2020. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a 10-day course of remdesivir (n = 197), a 5-day course of remdesivir (n = 199), or standard care (n = 200). Remdesivir was dosed intravenously at 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg/d. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was clinical status on day 11 on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from death (category 1) to discharged (category 7). Differences between remdesivir treatment groups and standard care were calculated using proportional odds models and expressed as odds ratios. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates difference in clinical status distribution toward category 7 for the remdesivir group vs the standard care group. RESULTS Among 596 patients who were randomized, 584 began the study and received remdesivir or continued standard care (median age, 57 [interquartile range, 46-66] years; 227 [39\%] women; 56\% had cardiovascular disease, 42\% hypertension, and 40\% diabetes), and 533 (91\%) completed the trial. Median length of treatment was 5 days for patients in the 5-day remdesivir group and 6 days for patients in the 10-day remdesivir group. On day 11, patients in the 5-day remdesivir group had statistically significantly higher odds of a better clinical status distribution than those receiving standard care (odds ratio, 1.65; 95\% CI, 1.09-2.48; P = .02). The clinical status distribution on day 11 between the 10-day remdesivir and standard care groups was not significantly different (P = .18 by Wilcoxon rank sum test). By day 28, 9 patients had died: 2 (1\%) in the 5-day remdesivir group, 3 (2\%) in the 10-day remdesivir group, and 4 (2\%) in the standard care group. Nausea (10\% vs 3\%), hypokalemia (6\% vs 2\%), and headache (5\% vs 3\%) were more frequent among remdesivir-treated patients compared with standard care. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with moderate COVID-19, those randomized to a 10-day course of remdesivir did not have a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared with standard care at 11 days after initiation of treatment. Patients randomized to a 5-day course of remdesivir had a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared with standard care, but the difference was of uncertain clinical importance.},

  abstract = {Besides the established spot sign (SS) in computed tomography angiography (CTA), there is growing evidence that different imaging markers in noncontrast CT offer great value for outcome prediction in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, it is unclear how the concurrent presence of each sign independently contributes to the predictive power of poor outcome. We, therefore, aimed to clarify the predictive value of 5 recently published noncontrast CT parameters (blend sign, black hole sign, island sign, hematoma heterogeneity, and hypodensities) and the established SS in 1 consecutive series of patients with ICH. Retrospective study of patients with ICH at 2 German tertiary stroke centers; inclusion criteria were (1) spontaneous ICH and (2) noncontrast CT and CTA performed on admission within 6 hours after onset of symptoms. We defined a binary outcome (good outcome [modified Rankin Scale score of {$\leq$}3] versus poor outcome [modified Rankin Scale score of {$>$}3]) at discharge. The predictive value of each sign was assessed in univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. Of 201 patients with spontaneous ICH, 28 (13.9\%) presented with black hole sign, 38 (18.9\%) with blend sign, 120 (59.7\%) with hypodensities, 97 (48.3\%) with heterogeneous densities, 53 with island sign (26.4\%), and 45 (22.4\%) with SS. In univariable logistic regression, higher hematoma volume (P{$<$}0.001), intraventricular hemorrhage (P=0.002), and the presence of black hole sign/blend sign/hypodensities/island sign/SS/heterogeneous density (all P{$<$}0.001) on admission CT were associated with poor outcome. Multivariable analysis confirmed intraventricular hemorrhage (odds ratio, 2.20; P=0.025), higher hematoma volume (odds ratio, 1.02 per mL; P{$<$}0.019), the presence of hypodensities (odds ratio, 2.47; P=0.018), and SS (odds ratio, 12.22; P{$<$}0.001) as independent predictors of poor outcome. This study demonstrates the degree of interaction between 5 recent noncontrast CT imaging markers and SS and their individual contribution for outcome prediction in patients with ICH. Of the CT variables indicating poor outcome SS on CTA and hypodensities were the most reliable outcome predictors.}

  abstract = {Background and Purpose- This study determined the influence of concomitant antiplatelet therapy (APT) on hematoma characteristics and outcome in primary spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), vitamin K antagonist (VKA)- and non-VKA oral anticoagulant-associated ICH. Methods- Data of retrospective cohort studies and a prospective single-center study were pooled. Functional outcome, mortality, and radiological characteristics were defined as primary and secondary outcomes. Propensity score matching and logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association between single or dual APT and hematoma volume. Results- A total of 3580 patients with ICH were screened, of whom 3545 with information on APT were analyzed. Three hundred forty-six (32.4\%) patients in primary spontaneous ICH, 260 (11.4\%) in VKA-ICH, and 30 (16.0\%) in non-VKA oral anticoagulant-associated ICH were on APT, and these patients had more severe comorbidities. After propensity score matching VKA-ICH patients on APT presented with less favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-3; APT, 48/202 [23.8\%] versus no APT, 187/587 [31.9\%]; P=0.030) and higher mortality (APT, 103/202 [51.0\%] versus no APT, 237/587 [40.4\%]; P=0.009), whereas no significant differences were present in primary spontaneous ICH and non-VKA oral anticoagulant-associated ICH. In VKA-ICH, hematoma volume was significantly larger in patients with APT (21.9 [7.4-61.4] versus 15.7 [5.7-44.5] mL; P=0.005). Multivariable regression analysis revealed an association of APT and larger ICH volumes (odds ratio, 1.80 [1.20-2.70]; P=0.005), which was more pronounced in dual APT and supratherapeutically anticoagulated patients. Conclusions- APT does not affect ICH characteristics and outcome in primary spontaneous ICH patients; however, it is associated with larger ICH volume and worse functional outcome in VKA-ICH, presumably by additive antihemostatic effects. Combination of anticoagulation and APT should, therefore, be diligently evaluated and restricted to the shortest possible time frame.},

Study Design and Setting: We selected all systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy containing a meta-analysis, published in January 2018 and retrieved in Medline through Ovid. All reviews reported a summary estimate of sensitivity and specificity. We requested the protocol from their authors and used the protocol and the information in the published review to reproduce the reported meta-analysis. Successful reproduction was defined as a result differing !1\% point from the reported point estimates; or reported primary study results that were in line with those of the actual primary study results; or if the data from the primary studies could be extracted without checking the data in the review first. Results: Of the 51 included reviews, 16 had a protocol registered in PROSPERO and five of those responded to our request for a protocol. Nineteen reviews (37\%) provided the 2\^A2 tables that were included in the meta-analysis. In 14 of those, the outcome of the metaanalysis could be reproduced. Considering the correctness of the numbers from the primary articles and the complete reporting of the search strategy, only one meta-analysis was fully replicable. Conclusion: Published meta-analyses of diagnostic test accuracy were poorly replicable. This was partly because of lack of information about the methods and data used, and partly because of mistakes in the data extraction or data reporting. \'O 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Clinical prediction models provide risk estimates for the presence of disease (diagnosis) or an event in the future course of disease (prognosis) for individual patients. Although publications that present and evaluate such models are becoming more frequent, the methodology is often suboptimal. We propose that seven steps should be considered in developing prediction models: (i) consideration of the research question and initial data inspection; (ii) coding of predictors; (iii) model specification; (iv) model estimation; (v) evaluation of model performance; (vi) internal validation; and (vii) model presentation. The validity of a prediction model is ideally assessed in fully independent data, where we propose four key measures to evaluate model performance: calibration-in-the-large, or the model intercept (A); calibration slope (B); discrimination, with a concordance statistic (C); and clinical usefulness, with decision-curve analysis (D). As an application, we develop and validate prediction models for 30-day mortality in patients with an acute myocardial infarction. This illustrates the usefulness of the proposed framework to strengthen the methodological rigour and quality for prediction models in cardiovascular research.}

We studied the agreement and validity of predictions for individual patients.Study Design and SettingWe compared predictions from five predictive logistic regression models for short-term mortality after AMI. Three models were developed previously, and two models were developed in the GUSTO-I data, where all five models were applied (n =40,830, 7.0\% 30-day mortality). Agreement was studied with weighted kappa statistics of categorized predictions. Validity was assessed by comparing observed frequencies with predictions (indicating calibration) and by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), indicating discriminative ability.ResultsThe predictions from the five models varied considerably for individual patients, with low agreement between most (kappa {$<$}0.6). Risk predictions from the three previously developed models were on average too high, which could be corrected by re-calibration of the model intercept. The AUC ranged from 0.76\textendash 0.78 and increased to 0.78\textendash 0.79 with re-estimated regression coefficients that were optimal for the GUSTO-I patients. The two more detailed GUSTO-I based models performed better (AUC {$\sim$}0.82).ConclusionModels with different predictors may have a similar validity while the agreement between predictions for individual patients is poor. The main concerns in the applicability of predictive models for AMI should relate to the selected predictors and average calibration.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The efficacy of interleukin-6 receptor blockade in hospitalized patients with corona\- virus disease 2019 (Covid-19) who are not receiving mechanical ventilation is unclear. METHODS We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, hyperinflammatory states, and at least two of the following signs: fever (body temperature {$>$}38\textdegree C), pulmonary infiltrates, or the need for supplemental oxygen in order to maintain an oxygen saturation greater than 92\%. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive standard care plus a single dose of either tocilizumab (8 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo. The primary outcome was intubation or death, assessed in a time-to-event analysis. The secondary efficacy outcomes were clinical worsening and discontinuation of supplemental oxygen among patients who had been receiving it at baseline, both assessed in time-to-event analyses.

This article was published on October 21, 2020, at NEJM.org. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2028836 Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020 Massachusetts Medical Society. RESULTS We enrolled 243 patients; 141 (58\%) were men, and 102 (42\%) were women. The median age was 59.8 years (range, 21.7 to 85.4), and 45\% of the patients were Hispanic or Latino. The hazard ratio for intubation or death in the tocilizumab group as compared with the placebo group was 0.83 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.38 to 1.81; P\,=\,0.64), and the hazard ratio for disease worsening was 1.11 (95\% CI, 0.59 to 2.10; P\,=\,0.73). At 14 days, 18.0\% of the patients in the tocilizumab group and 14.9\% of the patients in the placebo group had had worsening of disease. The median time to discontinuation of supplemental oxygen was 5.0 days (95\% CI, 3.8 to 7.6) in the tocilizumab group and 4.9 days (95\% CI, 3.8 to 7.8) in the placebo group (P\,=\,0.69). At 14 days, 24.6\% of the patients in the tocilizumab group and 21.2\% of the patients in the placebo group were still receiving supplemental oxygen. Patients who received tocilizumab had fewer serious infections than patients who received placebo. CONCLUSIONS Tocilizumab was not effective for preventing intubation or death in moderately ill hospitalized patients with Covid-19. Some benefit or harm cannot be ruled out, however, because the confidence intervals for efficacy comparisons were wide. (Funded by Genentech; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04356937.)},

  abstract = {Background: Recent studies have reported substantially decreased hospital mortality for sepsis, but data are scarcer on outcomes after hospital discharge. We studied mortality up to 1 year in Swedish intensive care unit (ICU) patients with and without sepsis. Methods: Demographic and medical data for all registered adult general ICU patients admitted between 01-01-2008 and 30-09-2016 were retrieved from the Swedish Intensive Care Registry and linked with the National Patient Register for comorbidity data and the Cause of Death Register for death dates. The population was divided in two cohorts; (a) Patients with a diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock and (b) All other ICU patients. Crude yearly mortality was calculated, and logistic regression was used to analyse predictors of mortality. Results: 28 886 sepsis and 221 941 nonsepsis ICU patients were identified. In the sepsis cohort, in 2008 unadjusted mortality was 32.6\% at hospital discharge, 32.7\% at 30 days, 39\% at 90 days and 46.8\% at 365 days. In 2016, mortality was 30.5\% at hospital discharge, 31.9\% at 30 days and 38\% at 90 days. Mortality at 365 days was 45.3\% in 2015. Corresponding nonsepsis mortality was 15.4\%, 16.2\%, 20\% and 26\% in 2008 and 15.6\%, 17.1\%, 20.7\% and 26.7\% in 2016/2015. No consistent decrease in odds of mortality was seen in the adjusted analysis. Conclusions: Mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock is high, with more than one in three patients not surviving three months after ICU admission, and adjusted mortality has not decreased convincingly in Sweden 2008-2016.},

Design: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database. Setting: Neurosciences critical care unit of a large academic tertiary care hospital. Patients: Adult patients (n \&equals; 2381) admitted to our neurosciences critical care unit from January 1997 to April 2000. Interventions: Introduction of a specialized neurocritical care team. Measurements and Main Results: Data obtained from the database included demographics, admission source, length of stay, neurosciences critical care unit and hospital disposition, admission Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score, and principal and secondary diagnoses. The introduction of a neurocritical care team in September 1998 was also collected, as was death at 1 yr after admission. Univariate analysis was carried out using Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, or chi-square test (significance, p {$<$} .05). A logistic regression model was used to create a prediction model for in-hospital and long-term mortality. A general linear model was used to determine predictors of length of stay (after log transformation). Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality included APACHE III (odds ratio, 1.07 \&lsqb;1.06\textendash 1.08\&rsqb;) and admission from another intensive care unit (odds ratio, 2.9 \&lsqb;1.4\textendash 6.2\&rsqb;). The presence of a neurocritical care team was an independent predictor of decreased mortality (odds ratio, 0.7 \&lsqb;0.5\textendash 1.0\&rsqb;, p \&equals; .044). Admission after the neurocritical care team was implemented was associated with reduced length of stay in both the neurosciences critical care unit (4.2 {$\pm$} 4.0 vs. 3.7 {$\pm$} 3.4, p {$<$} .001) and the hospital (9.9 {$\pm$} 8.0 vs. 8.4 {$\pm$} 6.9, p {$<$} .0001). There was no difference in readmission rates to the intensive care unit or discharge disposition to home before and after the neurocritical care team was established. The availability of the neurocritical care team was not associated with significant changes in long-term mortality. Factors independently associated with long-term mortality included female gender, admission from another intensive care unit, APACHE III score, and being moderately disabled before admission. Conclusion: Introduction of a neurocritical care team, including a full-time neurointensivist who coordinated care, was associated with significantly reduced in-hospital mortality and length of stay without changes in readmission rates or long-term mortality.}

Atorvastatin reduced the first occurrence of stroke and the first occurrence of a composite of vascular events. OBJECTIVES The aim of this post hoc analysis was to assess the occurrence of all (first and subsequent) vascular events and the effect of atorvastatin to reduce these events by vascular territory (cerebrovascular, coronary, or peripheral) in SPARCL. METHODS Treatment effects on total adjudicated vascular events, overall and by vascular territory, were summarized by marginal proportional hazards models. Vascular event rates were estimated for each treatment group with cumulative incidence functions. RESULTS The placebo group had an estimated 41.2 first and 62.7 total vascular events per 100 participants over 6 years. There were 164 fewer first and 390 fewer total vascular events in the atorvastatin group (total events hazard ratio: 0.68; 95\% confidence interval: 0.60 to 0.77). The total events reduction included 177 fewer cerebrovascular, 170 fewer coronary, and 43 fewer peripheral events. Over 6 years, an estimated 20 vascular events per 100 participants were avoided with atorvastatin treatment. CONCLUSIONS In participants with recent stroke or transient ischemic attack, the total number of vascular events prevented with atorvastatin was more than twice the number of first events prevented. Total event reduction provides a comprehensive metric to capture the totality of atorvastatin clinical efficacy in reducing disease burden after stroke or transient ischemic attack.

  abstract = {Purpose:\hspace{0.6em} We assessed the effects of a protocol restricting resuscitation fluid vs. a standard care protocol after initial resuscitation in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We randomised 151 adult patients with septic shock who had received initial fluid resuscitation in nine Scandinavian ICUs. In the fluid restriction group fluid boluses were permitted only if signs of severe hypoperfusion occurred, while in the standard care group fluid boluses were permitted as long as circulation continued to improve. Results:\hspace{0.6em} The co-primary outcome measures, resuscitation fluid volumes at day 5 and during ICU stay, were lower in the fluid restriction group than in the standard care group [mean differences -1.2 L (95 \% confidence interval -2.0 to -0.4); p {$<$} 0.001 and -1.4 L (-2.4 to -0.4) respectively; p {$<$} 0.001]. Neither total fluid inputs and balances nor serious adverse reactions differed statistically significantly between the groups. Major protocol violations occurred in 27/75 patients in the fluid restriction group. Ischaemic events occurred in 3/75 in the fluid restriction group vs. 9/76 in the standard care group (odds ratio 0.32; 0.08\textendash 1.27; p = 0.11), worsening of acute kidney injury in 27/73 vs. 39/72 (0.46; 0.23\textendash 0.92; p = 0.03), and death by 90 days in 25/75 vs. 31/76 (0.71; 0.36\textendash 1.40; p = 0.32). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} A protocol restricting resuscitation fluid successfully reduced volumes of resuscitation fluid compared with a standard care protocol in adult ICU patients with septic shock. The patient-centred outcomes all pointed towards benefit with fluid restriction, but our trial was not powered to show differences in these exploratory outcomes.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The benefits of early continuous neuromuscular blockade in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who are receiving mechanical ventilation remain unclear. METHODS We randomly assigned patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (defined by a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen of {$<$}150 mm Hg with a positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] of {$\geq$}8 cm of water) to a 48-hour continuous infusion of cisatracurium with concomitant deep sedation (intervention group) or to a usual-care approach without routine neuromuscular blockade and with lighter sedation targets (control group). The same mechanicalventilation strategies were used in both groups, including a strategy involving a high PEEP. The primary end point was in-hospital death from any cause at 90 days. RESULTS The trial was stopped at the second interim analysis for futility. We enrolled 1006 patients early after the onset of moderate-to-severe ARDS (median, 7.6 hours after onset). During the first 48 hours after randomization, 488 of the 501 patients (97.4\%) in the intervention group started a continuous infusion of cisatracurium (median duration of infusion, 47.8 hours; median dose, 1807 mg), and 86 of the 505 patients (17.0\%) in the control group received a neuromuscular blocking agent (median dose, 38 mg). At 90 days, 213 patients (42.5\%) in the intervention group and 216 (42.8\%) in the control group had died before hospital discharge (betweengroup difference, -0.3 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval, -6.4 to 5.9; P\,=\,0.93). While in the hospital, patients in the intervention group were less physically active and had more adverse cardiovascular events than patients in the control group.

While most patients are managed with triple-H therapy, endovascular treatments have been used when triple-H treatment cannot be used or is ineffective. An electronic literature search was conducted to identify English language articles published through October 2010 that addressed endovascular management of vasospasm. A total of 49 articles were identified, addressing endovascular treatment timing, intraarterial treatments, and balloon angioplasty. Most of the available studies investigated intra-arterial papaverine or balloon angioplasty. Both have generally been shown to successfully treat vasospasm and improve neurological condition, with no clear benefit from one treatment compared with another. There are reports of complications with both therapies including vessel rupture during angioplasty, intracranial hypertension, and possible neurotoxicity associated with papaverine. Limited data are available evaluating nicardipine or verapamil, with positive benefits reported with nicardipine and inconsistent benefits with verapamil.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The efficacy of interleukin-6 receptor antagonists in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is unclear. METHODS We evaluated tocilizumab and sarilumab in an ongoing international, multifactorial, adaptive platform trial. Adult patients with Covid-19, within 24 hours after starting organ support in the intensive care unit (ICU), were randomly assigned to receive tocilizumab (8 mg per kilogram of body weight), sarilumab (400 mg), or standard care (control). The primary outcome was respiratory and cardiovascular organ support\textendash free days, on an ordinal scale combining in-hospital death (assigned a value of -1) and days free of organ support to day 21. The trial uses a Bayesian statistical model with predefined criteria for superiority, efficacy, equivalence, or futility. An odds ratio greater than 1 represented improved survival, more organ support\textendash free days, or both. RESULTS Both tocilizumab and sarilumab met the predefined criteria for efficacy. At that time, 353 patients had been assigned to tocilizumab, 48 to sarilumab, and 402 to control. The median number of organ support\textendash free days was 10 (interquartile range, -1 to 16) in the tocilizumab group, 11 (interquartile range, 0 to 16) in the sarilumab group, and 0 (interquartile range, -1 to 15) in the control group. The median adjusted cumulative odds ratios were 1.64 (95\% credible interval, 1.25 to 2.14) for tocilizumab and 1.76 (95\% credible interval, 1.17 to 2.91) for sarilumab as compared with control, yielding posterior probabilities of superiority to control of more than 99.9\% and of 99.5\%, respectively. An analysis of 90-day survival showed improved survival in the pooled interleukin-6 receptor antagonist groups, yielding a hazard ratio for the comparison with the control group of 1.61 (95\% credible interval, 1.25 to 2.08) and a posterior probability of superiority of more than 99.9\%.

INTERVENTIONS The corticosteroid domain randomized participants to a fixed 7-day course of intravenous hydrocortisone (50 mg or 100 mg every 6 hours) (n = 143), a shock-dependent course (50 mg every 6 hours when shock was clinically evident) (n = 152), or no hydrocortisone (n = 108). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was organ support\textendash free days (days alive and free of ICU-based respiratory or cardiovascular support) within 21 days, where patients who died were assigned \textendash 1 day. The primary analysis was a bayesian cumulative logistic model that included all patients enrolled with severe COVID-19, adjusting for age, sex, site, region, time, assignment to interventions within other domains, and domain and intervention eligibility. Superiority was defined as the posterior probability of an odds ratio greater than 1 (threshold for trial conclusion of superiority {$>$}99\%). RESULTS After excluding 19 participants who withdrew consent, there were 384 patients (mean age, 60 years; 29\% female) randomized to the fixed-dose (n = 137), shock-dependent (n = 146), and no (n = 101) hydrocortisone groups; 379 (99\%) completed the study and were included in the analysis. The mean age for the 3 groups ranged between 59.5 and 60.4 years; most patients were male (range, 70.6\%-71.5\%); mean body mass index ranged between 29.7 and 30.9; and patients receiving mechanical ventilation ranged between 50.0\% and 63.5\%. For the fixed-dose, shock-dependent, and no hydrocortisone groups, respectively, the median organ support\textendash free days were 0 (IQR, \textendash 1 to 15), 0 (IQR, \textendash 1 to 13), and 0 (\textendash 1 to 11) days (composed of 30\%, 26\%, and 33\% mortality rates and 11.5, 9.5, and 6 median organ support\textendash free days among survivors). The median adjusted odds ratio and bayesian probability of superiority were 1.43 (95\% credible interval, 0.91-2.27) and 93\% for fixed-dose hydrocortisone, respectively, and were 1.22 (95\% credible interval, 0.76-1.94) and 80\% for shock-dependent hydrocortisone compared with no hydrocortisone. Serious adverse events were reported in 4 (3\%), 5 (3\%), and 1 (1\%) patients in the fixed-dose, shock-dependent, and no hydrocortisone groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with severe COVID-19, treatment with a 7-day fixed-dose course of hydrocortisone or shock-dependent dosing of hydrocortisone, compared with no hydrocortisone, resulted in 93\% and 80\% probabilities of superiority with regard to the odds of improvement in organ support\textendash free days within 21 days. However, the trial was stopped early and no treatment strategy met prespecified criteria for statistical superiority, precluding definitive conclusions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Antiplatelet therapy (APT) promotes bleeding; therefore, APT might worsen outcome in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to address the hypothesis that pre-ICH APT use is associated with mortality and poor functional outcome following ICH. METHODS: The Medline and Embase databases were searched in February 2008 using relevant key words, limited to human studies in the English language. Cohort studies of consecutive patients with ICH reporting mortality or functional outcome according to pre-ICH APT use were identified. Of 2,873 studies screened, 10 were judged to meet inclusion criteria by consensus of 2 authors. Additionally, we solicited unpublished data from all authors of cohort studies with {$>$}100 patients published within the last 10 years, and received data from 15 more studies. Univariate and multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for mortality and poor functional outcome were abstracted as available and pooled using a random effects model. RESULTS: We obtained mortality data from 25 cohorts (15 unpublished) and functional outcome data from 21 cohorts (14 unpublished). Pre-ICH APT users had increased mortality in both univariate (OR 1.41, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.21 to 1.64) and multivariable-adjusted (OR 1.27, 95\% CI 1.10 to 1.47) pooled analyses. By contrast, the pooled OR for poor functional outcome was no longer significant when using multivariable-adjusted estimates (univariate OR 1.29, 95\% CI 1.09 to 1.53; multivariable-adjusted OR 1.10, 95\% CI 0.93 to 1.29). CONCLUSIONS: In cohort studies, APT use at the time of ICH compared to no APT use was independently associated with increased mortality but not with poor functional outcome.},

METHODS: This was a subanalysis of an investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized, open-label, blinded\textendash end point trial. Patients with stroke with a time last-known-well {$>$}4.5 hours who showed a mismatch between diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive alteplase at 0.6 mg/kg intravenously or standard medical treatment. The patients were dichotomized by ischemic core size or National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and the effects of assigned treatments were compared in each group. The efficacy outcome was favorable outcome at 90 days, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1. RESULTS: The median DWI-Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (ASPECTS) was 9, and the median ischemic core volume was 2.5 mL. Both favorable outcome (47.1\% versus 48.3\%) and any intracranial hemorrhage (26\% versus 14\%) at 22 to 36 hours were comparable between the 68 thrombolyzed patients and the 58 control patients. There was a significant treatment-by-cohort interaction for favorable outcome between dichotomized patients by ASPECTS on DWI (P=0.026) and core volume (P=0.035). Favorable outcome was more common in the alteplase group than in the control group in patients with DWI-ASPECTS 5 to 8 (RR, 4.75 [95\% CI, 1.33\textendash 30.2]), although not in patients with DWI-ASPECTS 9 to 10. Favorable outcome tended to be more common in the alteplase group than in the control group in patients with core volume {$>$}6.4 mL (RR, 6.15 [95\% CI, 0.87\textendash 43.64]), although not in patients with volume {$\leq$}6.4 mL. The frequency of any intracranial hemorrhage did not differ significantly between the 2 treatment groups in any dichotomized patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients developing unknown onset stroke with DWI-ASPECTS 5 to 8 showed favorable outcomes more commonly after low-dose thrombolysis than after standard treatment.},

E Methods: Eligible patients were randomly assigned to a systolic BP (SBP) target of 110-139 mmHg (intensive treatment) or 140-179 mmHg (standard treatment). Pre-defined outcomes T were: poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of 4-6 at 90 days), death within P 90 days, hematoma expansion at 24 hours; and cardio-renal adverse events within 7 days. Results: Poor functional outcomes (32.0\% versus 45.9\%), death (1.9\% versus 13.3\%), and E cardio-renal adverse events (3.9\% versus 11.2\%) occurred significantly less in patients from Asia than those outside of Asia. The treatment-by-cohort interaction was not significant for C any outcomes. Only patients from Asia showed a lower incidence of hematoma expansion C with intensive treatment (adjusted RR 0.56, 95\% CI 0.38-0.83). Both Asian (3.53, 1.28-9.64) A and non-Asian cohorts (1.71, 1.00-2.93) showed a higher incidence of cardio-renal adverse events with intensive treatment. Conclusions: Poor functional outcomes and death 90 days after ICH were less common in patients from East Asia than those outside of Asia. Hematoma expansion, a potential predictor for poor clinical outcome, was attenuated by intensive BP lowering only in the Asian cohort.},

  abstract = {Background and Methods Although generalized convulsive status epilepticus is a life-threatening emergency, the best initial drug treatment is uncertain. We conducted a five-year randomized, doubleblind, multicenter trial of four intravenous regimens: diazepam (0.15 mg per kilogram of body weight) followed by phenytoin (18 mg per kilogram), lorazepam (0.1 mg per kilogram), phenobarbital (15 mg per kilogram), and phenytoin (18 mg per kilogram). Patients were classified as having either overt generalized status epilepticus (defined as easily visible generalized convulsions) or subtle status epilepticus (indicated by coma and ictal discharges on the electroencephalogram, with or without subtle convulsive movements such as rhythmic muscle twitches or tonic eye deviation). Treatment was considered successful when all motor and electroencephalographic seizure activity ceased within 20 minutes after the beginning of the drug infusion and there was no return of seizure activity during the next 40 minutes. Analyses were performed with data on only the 518 patients with verified generalized convulsive status epilepticus as well as with data on all 570 patients who were enrolled. Results Three hundred eighty-four patients had a verified diagnosis of overt generalized convulsive status epilepticus. In this group, lorazepam was successful in 64.9 percent of those assigned to receive it, phenobarbital in 58.2 percent, diazepam and phenytoin in 55.8 percent, and phenytoin in 43.6 percent (P=0.02 for the overall comparison among the four groups). Lorazepam was significantly superior to phenytoin in a pairwise comparison (P=0.002). Among the 134 patients with a verified diagnosis of subtle generalized convulsive status epilepticus, no significant differences among the treatments were detected (range of success rates, 7.7 to 24.2 percent). In an intention-to-treat analysis, the differences among treatment groups were not significant, either among the patients with overt status epilepticus (P=0.12) or among those with subtle status epilepticus (P=0.91). There were no differences among the treatments with respect to recurrence during the 12hour study period, the incidence of adverse reactions, or the outcome at 30 days. Conclusions As initial intravenous treatment for overt generalized convulsive status epilepticus, lorazepam is more effective than phenytoin. Although lorazepam is no more efficacious than phenobarbital or diazepam and phenytoin, it is easier to use. (N Engl J Med 1998;339:792-8.)},

  abstract = {Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is common in patients with coma with a prevalence between 5\% and 48\%. Patients in deep coma may exhibit epileptiform EEG patterns, such as generalized periodic spikes, and there is an ongoing debate about the relationship of these patterns and NCSE. The purposes of this review are (i) to discuss the various EEG patterns found in coma, its fluctuations, and transitions and (ii) to propose modified criteria for NCSE in coma. Classical coma patterns such as diffuse polymorphic delta activity, spindle coma, alpha/theta coma, low output voltage, or burst suppression do not reflect NCSE. Any ictal patterns with a typical spatiotemporal evolution or epileptiform discharges faster than 2.5 Hz in a comatose patient reflect nonconvulsive seizures or NCSE and should be treated. Generalized periodic diacharges or lateralized periodic discharges (GPDs/LPDs) with a frequency of less than 2.5 Hz or rhythmic discharges (RDs) faster than 0.5 Hz are the borderland of NCSE in coma. In these cases, at least one of the additional criteria is needed to diagnose NCSE (a) subtle clinical ictal phenomena, (b) typical spatiotemporal evolution, or (c) response to antiepileptic drug treatment. There is currently no consensus about how long these patterns must be present to qualify for NCSE, and the distinction from nonconvulsive seizures in patients with critical illness or in comatose patients seems arbitrary.},

  abstract = {Literature suggest that hypertonic saline (HTS) solution with sodium chloride concentration greater than the physiologic 0.9\% can be useful in controlling elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and as a resuscitative agent in multiple settings including traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this review, we discuss HTS mechanisms of action, adverse effects, and current clinical studies. Studies show that HTS administered during the resuscitation of patients with a TBI improves neurological outcome. HTS also has positive effects on elevated ICP from multiple etiologies, and for shock resuscitation. However, a prospective randomized Australian study using an aggressive resuscitation protocol in trauma patients showed no difference in amount of fluids administered during prehospital resuscitation, and no differences in ICP control or neurological outcome. The role of HTS in prehospital resuscitation is yet to be determined. The most important factor in improving outcomes may be prevention of hypotension and preservation of cerebral blood flow. In regards to control of elevated ICP during the inpatient course, HTS appears safe and effective. Although clinicians currently use HTS with some success, significant questions remain as to the dose and manner of HTS infusion. Direct protocol comparisons should be performed to improve and standardize patient care.},

It is difficult to diagnose, partly due to its relative rarity, its multiple and various clinical manifestations (different from `conventional' stroke, and often mimicking other acute neurological conditions), and because it is often challenging to obtain and interpret optimal and timely brain imaging. Although CVT can result in death or permanent disability, it generally has a favourable prognosis if diagnosed and treated early. Neurologists involved in stroke care therefore also need to be aware of the treatments for CVT (with varying degrees of supporting evidence): the mainstay is prompt anticoagulation but patients who deteriorate despite treatment can be considered for endovascular procedures (endovascular thrombolysis or thrombectomy) or neurosurgery (decompressive craniotomy). This review summarises current knowledge on the risk factors, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of CVT in adults, and highlights some areas for future research.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash There is no effective medical treatment of malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction. The purpose of this clinical trial was to assess the efficacy of early decompressive craniectomy in patients with malignant MCA infarction. Methods\textemdash We conducted in France a multicenter, randomized trial involving patients between 18 and 55 years of age with malignant MCA infarction to compare functional outcomes with or without decompressive craniectomy. A sequential, single-blind, triangular design was used to compare the rate of development of moderate disability (modified Rankin scale score Յ3) at 6 months' follow-up (primary outcome) between the 2 treatment groups. Results\textemdash After randomization of 38 patients, the data safety monitoring committee recommended stopping the trial because of slow recruitment and organizing a pooled analysis of individual data from this trial and the 2 other ongoing European trials of decompressive craniectomy in malignant MCA infarction. Among the 38 patients randomized, the proportion of patients with a modified Rankin scale score Յ3 at the 6-month and 1-year follow-up was 25\% and 50\%, respectively, in the surgery group compared with 5.6\% and 22.2\%, respectively, in the no-surgery group (Pϭ0.18 and Pϭ0.10, respectively). There was a 52.8\% absolute reduction of death after craniectomy compared with medical therapy only (PϽ0.0001). Conclusions\textemdash In this trial, early decompressive craniectomy increased by more than half the number of patients with moderate disability and very significantly reduced (by more than half) the mortality rate compared with that after medical therapy.

  abstract = {Intracerebral hemorrhage is a devastating disease with no specific treatment modalities. A significant proportion of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage are transferred to large stroke treatment centers, such as Comprehensive Stroke Centers, because of perceived need for higher level of care. However, evidence of improvement in patient-centered outcomes for these patients treated at larger stroke treatment centers as compared to community hospitals is lacking. ``Efficient Resource Utilization for Patients with Intracerebral Hemorrhage (EnRICH)'' is a prospective, multisite, state-wide, cohort study designed to assess the impact of level of care on long-term patient-centered outcomes for patients with primary / non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage. The study is funded by the Texas state legislature via the Lone Star Stroke Research Consortium. It is being implemented via major hub hospitals in large metropolitan cities across the state of Texas. Each hub has an extensive network of ``spoke'' hospitals, which are connected to the hub via traditional clinical and administrative arrangements, or by telemedicine technologies. This infrastructure provides a unique opportunity to track outcomes for intracerebral hemorrhage patients managed across a health system at various levels of care. Eligible patients are enrolled during hospitalization and are followed for functional, quality of life, cognitive, resource utilization, and dependency outcomes at 30 and 90 days post discharge. As a secondary aim, an economic analysis of the incremental cost-effectiveness of treating intracerebral hemorrhage patients at higher levels of care will be conducted. Findings from EnRICH will provide much needed evidence of the effectiveness and efficiency of regionalized care for intracerebral hemorrhage patients. Such evidence is required to inform policy and streamline clinical decision-making.}

This Primer describes the stages involved in Bayesian analysis, from specifying the prior and data models to deriving inference, model checking and refinement. We discuss the importance of prior and posterior predictive checking, selecting a proper technique for sampling from a posterior distribution, variational inference and variable selection.

Little attention has been paid to sodium administration as a separate cause of harm. With this narrative review, we aim to substantiate the hypothesis that a considerable amount of fluid-induced harm is caused not only by fluid volume, but also by the sodium that is administered to hospitalized patients. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We show how a regular dietary sodium intake is easily surpassed by the substantial amounts of sodium that are administered during typical hospital stays. The most significant sodium burdens are caused by isotonic maintenance fluid therapy and by fluid creep, defined as the large volume unintentionally administered to patients in the form of dissolved medication. In a section on physiology, we elaborate on the limited renal handling of an acute sodium load. We demonstrate how the subsequent retention of water is an energy-demanding, catabolic process and how free water is needed to excrete large burdens of sodium. We quantify the effect size of sodium-induced fluid retention and discuss its potential clinical impact. Finally, we propose preventive measures, discuss the benefits and risks of low-sodium maintenance fluid therapy, and explore options for reducing the amount of sodium caused by fluid creep. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} The sodium burdens caused by isotonic maintenance fluids and fluid creep are responsible for an additional and avoidable derailment of fluid balance, with presumed clinical consequences. Moreover, the handling of sodium overload is characterized by increased catabolism. Easy and effective measures for reducing sodium load and fluid retention include choosing a hypotonic rather than isotonic maintenance fluid strategy (or avoiding these fluids when enough free water is provided through other sources) and dissolving as many medications as possible in glucose 5\%.},

We illustrate four statistical approaches that address all three sources of bias, namely, multiple imputation for missing data and measurement error, multiple imputation combined with regression calibration, full-information maximum likelihood within a structural equation modeling framework, and a Bayesian model. In a simulation study we assess the performance of the four approaches compared to more commonly used approaches that do not account for measurement error, missing values, or confounding. Results. The results demonstrate that the four approaches consistently outperform the alternative approaches on all performance metrics (bias, mean squared error, confidence interval coverage). Even in simulated data of 100 subjects, these approaches perform well. Conclusion.

We therefore conducted a trial to determine whether ventilation with lower tidal volumes would improve the clinical outcomes in these patients. Methods Patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized trial. The trial compared traditional ventilation treatment, which involved an initial tidal volume of 12 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and an airway pressure measured after a 0.5-second pause at the end of inspiration (plateau pressure) of 50 cm of water or less, with ventilation with a lower tidal volume, which involved an initial tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and a plateau pressure of 30 cm of water or less. The first primary outcome was death before a patient was discharged home and was breathing without assistance. The second primary outcome was the number of days without ventilator use from day 1 to day 28. Results The trial was stopped after the enrollment of 861 patients because mortality was lower in the group treated with lower tidal volumes than in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes (31.0 percent vs. 39.8 percent, P=0.007), and the number of days without ventilator use during the first 28 days after randomization was greater in this group (mean [{$\pm$}SD], 12{$\pm$}11 vs. 10{$\pm$}11; P=0.007). The mean tidal volumes on days 1 to 3 were 6.2{$\pm$}0.8 and 11.8{$\pm$}0.8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight (P{$<$}0.001), respectively, and the mean plateau pressures were 25{$\pm$}6 and 33{$\pm$}8 cm of water (P{$<$}0.001), respectively. Conclusions In patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation with a lower tidal volume than is traditionally used results in decreased mortality and increases the number of days without ventilator use.

  abstract = {The neurologic morbidity of delayed ischemic deficits from vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) continues to be the most debilitating complication from this devastating illness. Neurologic critical care is focused on recognition and treatment of these secondary insults but often the treatment is withheld until an irreversible deficit becomes manifest. Continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring provides a unique potential to recognize early secondary insults and offers an opportunity for early intervention. We studied 32 SAH patients using cEEG and trending of the quantitative measure, relative alpha (RA), to determine if reductions in RA variability occurred with documented vasospasm. In 19/19 patients with angiographically documented vasospasm, we found that RA variability was decreased by a mean of two grades and improved with resolution of vasospasm. In 10/19 this reduction in RA variability preceded the diagnosis of vasospasm by a mean of 2.9 days (SD 1.73). The positive predictive and negative predictive values are 76\% and 100\%, respectively. Non-diagnostic clinical signs at the time of RA variability reduction and vasospasm were present in 12/19 patients. Thus decreased RA variability is able to provide early detection of neurologic complications such as vasospasm in patients before clear clinical symptoms and signs occur. \textcopyright{} 1997 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

  abstract = {Modalities of fluid management in patients sustaining the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are challenging and controversial. Optimal fluid management should provide adequate oxygen delivery to the body, while avoiding inadvertent increase in lung edema which further impairs gas exchange. In ARDS patients, positive fluid balance has been associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, longer ICU and hospital stay, and higher mortality. Accordingly, a restrictive strategy has been compared to a more liberal approach in randomized controlled trials conducted in various clinical settings. Restrictive strategies included fluid restriction guided by the monitoring of extravascular lung water, pulmonary capillary wedge or central venous pressure, and furosemide targeted to diuresis and/or albumin replacement in hypoproteinemic patients. Overall, restrictive strategies improved oxygenation significantly and reduced duration of mechanical ventilation, but had no significant effect on mortality. Fluid management may require different approaches depending on the time course of ARDS (i.e., early vs. late period). The effects of fluid strategy management according to ARDS phenotypes remain to be evaluated. Since ARDS is frequently associated with sepsis-induced acute circulatory failure, the prediction of fluid responsiveness is crucial in these patients to avoid hemodynamically inefficient\textemdash hence respiratory detrimental\textemdash fluid administration. Specific hemodynamic indices of fluid responsiveness or mini-fluid challenges should be preferably used. Since the positive airway pressure contributes to positive fluid balance in ventilated ARDS patients, it should be kept as low as possible. As soon as the hemodynamic status is stabilized, correction of cumulated fluid retention may rely on diuretics administration or renal replacement therapy.},

DATA SOURCES PubMed and medRxiv were searched from database inception to July 28, 2020, and a total of 13 926 studies were identified, with additional studies identified through hand searching of cited references and professional contacts. STUDY SELECTION Studies that provided data on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adolescents (younger than 20 years) compared with adults (20 years and older) derived from contact tracing or population screening were included. Single-household studies were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS PRISMA guidelines for abstracting data were followed, which was performed independently by 2 reviewers. Quality was assessed using a critical appraisal checklist for prevalence studies. Random-effects meta-analysis was undertaken. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Secondary infection rate (contact-tracing studies) or prevalence or seroprevalence (population screening studies) among children and adolescents compared with adults. RESULTS A total of 32 studies comprising 41 640 children and adolescents and 268 945 adults met inclusion criteria, including 18 contact-tracing studies and 14 population screening studies. The pooled odds ratio of being an infected contact in children compared with adults was 0.56 (95\% CI, 0.37-0.85), with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 94.6\%). Three school-based contact-tracing studies found minimal transmission from child or teacher index cases. Findings from population screening studies were heterogenous and were not suitable for meta-analysis. Most studies were consistent with lower seroprevalence in children compared with adults, although seroprevalence in adolescents appeared similar to adults. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this meta-analysis, there is preliminary evidence that children and adolescents have lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, with an odds ratio of 0.56 for being an infected contact compared with adults. There is weak evidence that children and adolescents play a lesser role than adults in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at a population level. This study provides no information on the infectivity of children.},

  abstract = {People who are well may regard survival with disability as being worse than death. However, this is often not the case when those surviving with disability (e.g. stroke survivors) are asked the same question. Many routine treatments provided after an acute stroke (e.g. feeding via a tube) increase survival, but with disability. Therefore, clinicians need to support patients and families in making informed decisions about the use of these treatments, in a process termed shared decision making. This is challenging after acute stroke: there is prognostic uncertainty, patients are often too unwell to participate in decision making, and proxies may not know the patients' expressed wishes (i.e. values). Patients' values also change over time and in different situations. There is limited evidence on successful methods to facilitate this process. Changes targeted at components of shared decision making (e.g. decision aids to provide information and discussing patient values) increase patient satisfaction. How this influences decision making is unclear. Presumably, a ``shared decision-making tool'' that introduces effective changes at various stages in this process might be helpful after acute stroke. For example, by complementing professional judgement with predictions from prognostic models, clinicians could provide information that is more accurate. Decision aids that are personalized may be helpful. Further qualitative research can provide clinicians with a better understanding of patient values and factors influencing this at different time points after a stroke. The evaluation of this tool in its success to achieve outcomes consistent with patients' values may require more than one clinical trial.},

Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for studies in English, German, and Spanish between 1990 and 2019, reporting outcomes in patients with SABI who underwent tracheostomy. We adhered to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines and the meta-analyses of observational studies in epidemiology guidelines. We excluded studies reporting on less than 10 patients, mixed populations with other neurological diseases, or studies assessing highly select subgroups defined by age or procedures. Data were extracted independently by two investigators. Results were pooled using random effects modeling. The primary outcome was long-term functional outcome (mRS or GOS) at 6\textendash 12 months. Secondary outcomes included hospital and long-term mortality, decannulation rates, and discharge home rates. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Of 1405 studies identified, 61 underwent full manuscript review and 19 studies comprising 35,362 patients from 10 countries were included in the meta-analysis. The primary outcome was available from five studies with 451 patients. At 6\textendash 12 months, about one-third of patients (30\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 17\textendash 48) achieved independence, and about one-third survived in a dependent state (36\%, 95\% CI 28\textendash 46\%). The pooled short-term mortality for 19,048 patients was 12\%, (95\% CI 9\textendash 17\%) with no significant difference between stroke (10\%) and TBI patients (13\%), and the pooled long-term mortality was 21\% (95\% CI 11\textendash 36). Decannulation occurred in 79\% (95\% CI 51\textendash 93\%) of survivors. Heterogeneity was high for most outcome assessments \-(I2\,{$>$}\,75\%). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Our findings suggest that about one in three patients with SABI who undergo tracheostomy may eventually achieve independence. Future research is needed to understand the reasons for the heterogeneity between studies and to identify those patients with promising outcomes as well as factors influencing outcome.},

  abstract = {In 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) instituted an all-or-none sepsis performance measure bundle (SEP-1) to promote high-quality, cost-effective care. Systematic reviews demonstrated only low-quality evidence supporting most of SEP-1's interventions. CMS has removed some but not all of these unproven components. The current SEP-1 version requires patients with suspected sepsis have a lactate level, blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if hypotensive, a fixed 30 mL/kg fluid infusion within 3 hours, and a repeat lactate if initially elevated within 6 hours. Experts have continued to raise concerns that SEP-1 remains overly prescriptive, lacks a sound scientific basis and presents risks (overuse of antibiotics and inappropriate fluids not titrated to need). To incentivize compliance with SEP-1, CMS now publicly publishes how often hospitals complete all interventions in individual patients. However, compliance measured across hospitals (5 studies, 48\textendash 2,851 hospitals) or patients (three studies, 110\textendash 851 patients) has been low (approximately 50\%) which is not surprising given SEP-1's lack of scientific basis. The largest observational study (1,738 patients) reporting survival rates employing SEP-1 found they were not significantly improved with the measure (P=0.53) as did the next largest study (851 patients, adjusted survival odds ratio 1.36, 95\% CI, 0.85 to 2.18). Two smaller observational studies (158 and 450 patients) reported SEP-1 improved unadjusted survival (P{$\leq$}0.05) but were confounded either by baseline imbalances or by simultaneous introduction of a code sepsis protocol to improve compliance. Regardless, retrospective studies have well known biases related to non-randomized designs, uncontrolled data collection and failure to adjust for unrecognized influential variables. Such low-quality science should not be the basis for a national mandate compelling care for a rapidly lethal disease with a high mortality rate. Instead, SEP-1 should be based on high quality reproducible evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) demonstrating its benefit and thereby safety. Otherwise we risk not only doing harm but standardizing it.},

Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We searched for randomized controlled trials that examined the efficacy and safety of gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis with PPIs, H2RAs, or sucralfate versus one another or placebo or no prophylaxis in adult critically ill patients. We performed Bayesian random-effects NMA and conducted analyses using all PEPTIC data as well as a restricted analysis using only PEPTIC data from high compliance centers. We used the GRADE approach to quantify absolute effects and assess the certainty of evidence. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Seventy-four trials enrolling 39 569 patients proved eligible. Both PPIs (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95\% credible interval 0.93 to 1.14, moderate certainty) and H2RAs (RR 0.98, 0.89 to 1.08, moderate certainty) probably have little or no impact on mortality compared with no prophylaxis. There may be no important difference between PPIs and H2RAs on mortality (RR 1.05, 0.97 to 1.14, low certainty), the 95\% credible interval of the complete analysis has not excluded an important increase in mortality with PPIs. Both PPIs (RR 0.46, 0.29 to 0.66) and H2RAs (RR 0.67, 0.48 to 0.94) probably reduce clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding; the magnitude of reduction is probably greater in PPIs than H2RAs (RR 0.69, 0.45 to 0.93), and the difference may be important in higher, but not lower bleeding risk patients. PPIs (RR 1.08, 0.88 to 1.45, low certainty) and H2RAs (RR 1.07, 0.85 to 1.37, low certainty) may have no important impact on pneumonia compared with no prophylaxis. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} This updated NMA confirmed that PPIs and H2RAs are most likely to have a similar effect on mortality compared to each other and compared to no prophylaxis; however, the possibility that PPIs may slightly increase mortality cannot be excluded (low certainty evidence). PPIs and H2RAs probably achieve important reductions in clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding; for higher bleeding risk patients, the greater benefit of PPIs over H2RAs},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND In patients with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that has not responded to medication, catheter ablation is more effective than antiarrhythmic drug therapy for maintaining sinus rhythm. However, the safety and efficacy of cryoballoon ablation as initial first-line therapy have not been established. METHODS We performed a multicenter trial in which patients 18 to 80 years of age who had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation for which they had not previously received rhythmcontrol therapy were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive treatment with anti\- arrhythmic drugs (class I or III agents) or pulmonary vein isolation with a cryoballoon. Arrhythmia monitoring included 12-lead electrocardiography conducted at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months; patient-activated telephone monitoring conducted weekly and when symptoms were present during months 3 through 12; and 24-hour ambulatory monitoring conducted at 6 and 12 months. The primary efficacy end point was treatment success (defined as freedom from initial failure of the procedure or atrial arrhythmia recurrence after a 90-day blanking period to allow recovery from the procedure or drug dose adjustment, evaluated in a Kaplan\textendash Meier analysis). The primary safety end point was assessed in the ablation group only and was a composite of several procedure-related and cryoballoon system\textendash related serious adverse events. RESULTS Of the 203 participants who underwent randomization and received treatment, 104 underwent ablation, and 99 initially received drug therapy. In the ablation group, initial success of the procedure was achieved in 97\% of patients. The Kaplan\textendash Meier estimate of the percentage of patients with treatment success at 12 months was 74.6\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 65.0 to 82.0) in the ablation group and 45.0\% (95\% CI, 34.6 to 54.7) in the drug-therapy group (P{$<$}0.001 by log-rank test). Two primary safety end-point events occurred in the ablation group (Kaplan\textendash Meier estimate of the percentage of patients with an event within 12 months, 1.9\%; 95\% CI, 0.5 to 7.5).

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Supplemental oxygen administration to critically ill patients is ubiquitous in the intensive care unit (ICU). Uncertainty persists as to whether hyperoxia is benign in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly in regard to their long-term functional neurological outcomes. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study of invasively ventilated patients with TBI admitted to the ICU. A database linkage between the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database (ANZICS-APD) and the Victorian State Trauma Registry (VSTR) was utilized. The primary exposure variable was minimum acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) III \-PaO2 in the first 24 h of ICU. We defined hypoxia as P\- aO2\,{$<$}\,60 mmHg, normoxia as 60\textendash 299 mmHg, and hyperoxia as\,{$\geq$}\,300 mmHg. The primary outcome was a Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE)\,{$<$}\,5 at 6 months while secondary outcomes included 12 and 24 months GOSE and mortality at each of these timepoints. Additional sensitivity analyses were undertaken in the following subgroups: isolated head injury, patients with operative intervention, head injury severity, and P\- aO2 either subcategorized by increments of 60 mmHg or treated as a continuous variable. Results:\hspace{0.6em} A total of 3699 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 42.8 years, 77.7\% were male and the mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) III score was 60.1 (26.3). 2842 patients experienced normoxia, and 783 hyperoxia. The primary outcome occurred in 1470 (47.1\%) of patients overall with 1123 (47.1\%) from the normoxia group and 312 (45.9\%) from the hyperoxia group\textemdash odds ratio 0.99 (0.78\textendash 1.25). No significant differences in outcomes between groups at 6, 12, and 24 months were observed. Sensitivity analyses did not identify subgroups that were adversely affected by exposure to hyperoxia. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} No associations were observed between hyperoxia in ICU during the first 24 h and adverse neurological outcome at 6 months in ventilated TBI patients.},

An exhaustive review of the additional literature published since the last guideline has demonstrated that both the structure and process of care in the ICU are important for achieving optimal patient outcomes. Since the publication of the original guideline, several authorities have recognized that improvements in the processes of care, ICU structure, and the use of quality improvement science methodologies can beneficially impact patient outcomes and reduce costs. Herein, we summarize findings of the American College of Critical Care Medicine Task Force on Models of Critical Care: 1) An intensivist-led, high-performing, multidisciplinary team dedicated to the ICU is an integral part of effective care delivery; 2) Process improvement is the backbone of achieving high-quality ICU outcomes; 3) Standardized protocols including care bundles and order sets to facilitate measurable processes and outcomes should be used and further developed in the ICU setting; and 4) Institutional support for comprehensive quality improvement programs as well as tele-ICU programs should be provided.}

  abstract = {Introduction: Limited data suggest mild hypernatremia may be related to lower intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The practice at the study center has been to use hypertonic saline (HTS) to generate a targeted serum sodium of 145 to 155 mEq/l in patients with TBI. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between serum sodium values and ICP, and to evaluate the acute effect of HTS on ICP. Methods: A retrospective review of patients who were admitted to the trauma ICU for TBI, had an ICP monitor placed, and received at least one dose of HTS between January 2006 and March 2011 was performed. Data were collected for up to 120 hours after ICP monitor placement. The primary outcome was the relationship between serum sodium and maximum ICP. Secondary outcomes were the relationship between serum sodium and the mean number of daily interventions for ICP control, and the acute effect of HTS on ICP during the 6 hours after each dose. Linear regression was used to analyze the primary outcome. Analysis of variance on ranks and repeated measures analysis of variance were used to evaluate the number of interventions and the acute effect of HTS on ICP, respectively. Results: Eighty-one patients were enrolled with mean {$\pm$} standard deviation age of 36 {$\pm$} 15 years and median Glasgow Coma Scale score of 7 (interquartile range, 4 to 7). A total of 1,230 serum sodium values (range, 118 to174 mEq/l) and 7,483 ICP values (range, 0 to 159 mmHg) were collected. There was no correlation between serum sodium and maximum ICP (R2 = 0.0052). The overall mean {$\pm$} standard deviation number of interventions for elevated ICP per day was 4.2 {$\pm$} 2.9, 2.9 {$\pm$} 2.0, and 2.6 {$\pm$} 2.3 for patients with a mean serum sodium of {$<$} 145, 145 to 155, and {$>$} 155 mEq/l, respectively (P {$<$} 0.001). Regarding the acute effect of HTS on ICP, there was no statistical difference in mean ICP compared with baseline during hours 1 through 6 following HTS doses (baseline, 13.7 {$\pm$} 8.4 mmHg; hour 1, 13.6 {$\pm$} 8.3 mmHg; hour 2, 13.5 {$\pm$} 8.8 mmHg; hour 3, 13.3 {$\pm$} 8.7 mmHg; hour 4, 13.4 {$\pm$} 8.7 mmHg; hour 5, 13.4 {$\pm$} 8.3 mmHg; hour 6, 13.5 {$\pm$} 8.3 mmHg; P = 0.84). Conclusions: Serum sodium concentrations did not correlate with ICP values. These results warrant further evaluation and possible reassessment of sodium goals for ICP management in patients with TBI.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The comparative effectiveness of direct-acting oral anticoagulants, compared with warfarin, for risks of stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, or death have not been studied in Medicare beneficiaries with atrial fibrillation and nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease. METHODS: Medicare data from 2011 to 2017 were used to identify patients with stages 3, 4, or 5 chronic kidney disease and new atrial fibrillation who received a new prescription for warfarin, apixaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran. We estimated marginal hazard ratios with 95\% CIs for the association of each direct-acting oral anticoagulant, compared with warfarin, for the outcomes of interest using inverse-probability-of-treatment weighted Cox proportional hazards models in as-treated and intention-to-treat analyses. RESULTS: A total of 22\,739 individuals met criteria (46.3\% warfarin, 29.6\% apixaban, 17.2\% rivaroxaban, 6.9\% dabigatran). Across the groups of anticoagulant users, mean age was 78.4 to 79.0 years; 50.3\% to 51.4\% were women, and 80.3\% to 82.8\% had stage 3 chronic kidney disease. In the as-treated analysis, for stroke/systemic embolism, hazard ratios, all compared with warfarin, were 0.70 (0.51\textendash 0.96) for apixaban, 0.80 (0.54\textendash 1.17) for rivaroxaban, and 1.15 (0.69\textendash 1.94) for dabigatran. For major bleeding, analogous hazard ratios were 0.47 (0.37\textendash 0.59) for apixaban, 1.05 (0.85\textendash 1.30) for rivaroxaban, and 0.95 (0.70\textendash 1.31) for dabigatran. There was no difference in the risk of all-cause mortality between the direct-acting oral anticoagulants and warfarin. Results of the intention-to-treat analysis were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban, compared with warfarin, was associated with decreased risk of stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding; risks for both outcomes with rivaroxaban and dabigatran did not differ from risks with warfarin.},

The aim of this scop-ing review is to assess the epidemiology and management strategies of NOAF during critical illness. Method:\hspace{0.6em} The review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library for studies assessing the incidence, outcome and management strategies of NOAF in adult critically ill patients. The quality of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results:\hspace{0.6em} A total of 99 studies were included, of which 79 were observational and 20 were interventional. The inci-dence of NOAF varied from 1.7\% to 43.9\% with considerable inter-population variation (very low quality of evidence). Commonly identified risk factors for NOAF included higher age, cardiovascular comorbidities and sepsis. The occur-rence of NOAF was associated with adverse outcomes, including stroke, prolonged length of stay and mortality (very low quality of evidence). We found limited data on the optimal management strategy with no evidence for firm benefit or harm for any intervention (very low/low quality of evidence). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} The definition and incidence of NOAF in critically ill patients varied considerably and many risk factors were identified. NOAF seemed to be associated with adverse outcomes, but data were very limited and current man-agement strategies are not evidence-based.},

The assessment is often confounded by the treatment paradigms of modern intensive care (ie, drugs, drug interactions and targeted temperature management). Patients may be too unstable to leave the intensive care unit for neuroimaging; thus, repeated clinical examinations are decisive. Despite diverse causes, certain principles do apply: (1) Many patients can improve, although with significant abnormalities; (2) Neuroimaging and electrodiagnostic tests can help but are rarely definitive; (3) Secondary involvement of the upper brainstem marks a tipping point with much lower probability for an independent outcome; (4) We rarely predict mortality or diagnose brain death; usually the major concern is anticipated neurological deficits; and (5) Prior comorbidity and permanent organ dysfunction are critical factors in making decisions about de-\-escalation or escalation of care. This review provides a practical approach to evaluating outcome of a comatose patient. Prognostication is difficult, and we should only attempt it when the diagnosis is confirmed and appropriate (often aggressive) medical or surgical treatment has been tried.},

  abstract = {Objective: Randomized trials generally use ``frequentist'' statistics based on P-values and 95\% confidence intervals. Frequentist methods have limitations that might be overcome, in part, by Bayesian inference. To illustrate these advantages, we re-analyzed randomized trials published in four general medical journals during 2004. Study Design and Setting: We used Medline to identify randomized superiority trials with two parallel arms, individual-level randomization and dichotomous or time-to-event primary outcomes. Studies with P ! 0.05 in favor of the intervention were deemed ``positive''; otherwise, they were ``negative.'' We used several prior distributions and exact conjugate analyses to calculate Bayesian posterior probabilities for clinically relevant effects. Results: Of 88 included studies, 39 were positive using a frequentist analysis. Although the Bayesian posterior probabilities of any benefit (relative risk or hazard ratio ! 1) were high in positive studies, these probabilities were lower and variable for larger benefits. The positive studies had only moderate probabilities for exceeding the effects that were assumed for calculating the sample size. By comparison, there were moderate probabilities of any benefit in negative studies. Conclusion: Bayesian and frequentist analyses complement each other when interpreting the results of randomized trials. Future reports of randomized trials should include both. \'O 2008 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine demographic and clinical factors associated with the decision to withdraw LST in patients with sTBI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective analysis of inpatient data from more than 825 trauma centers across the US in the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program database from January 2013 to December 2015 included adult patients with sTBI and documentation of a decision regarding withdrawal of LST (WLST). Data analysis was conducted in September 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Factors associated with WLST in sTBI. RESULTS A total of 37931 patients (9817 women [25.9\%]) were included in the multivariable analysis; 7864 (20.7\%) had WLST. Black patients (4806 [13.2\%]; odds ratio [OR], 0.66; 95\% CI, 0.59-0.72; P {$<$} .001) and patients of other race (4798 [13.2\%]; OR, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.76-0.91; P {$<$} .001) were less likely than white patients (26 864 [73.7\%]) to have WLST. Patients from hospitals in the Midwest (OR, 1.12; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.20; P = .002) or Northeast (OR, 1.23; 95\% CI, 1.13-1.34; P {$<$} .001) were more likely to have WLST than patients from hospitals in the South. Patients with Medicare (OR, 1.55; 95\% CI, 1.43-1.69; P {$<$} .001) and self-pay patients (OR, 1.36; 95\% CI, 1.25-1.47; P {$<$} .001) were more likely to have WLST than patients with private insurance. Older patients and those with lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores, higher Injury Severity Scores, or craniotomy were generally more likely to have WLST. Withdrawal of LST was more likely for patients with functionally dependent health status (OR, 1.30; 95\% CI, 1.08-1.58; P = .01), hematoma (OR, 1.19; 95\% CI, 1.12-1.27; P {$<$} .001), dementia (OR, 1.29; 95\% CI, 1.08-1.53; P = .004), and disseminated cancer (OR, 2.82; 95\% CI, 2.07-3.82; P {$<$} .001) than for patients without these conditions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Withdrawal of LST is common in sTBI and socioeconomic factors are associated with the decision to withdraw LST. These results highlight the many factors that contribute to decision-making in sTBI and demonstrate that in a complex and variable disease process, variation based on race, payment, and region presents as a potential challenge.},

Multiple predisposing factors (for example, pre-e xisting cognitive impairment) and precipitating factors (for example, urinary tract infection) for delirium have been described, with most patients having both types. Because multiple factors are implicated in the aetiology of delirium, there are likely several neurobiological processes that contribute to delirium pathogenesis, including neuroinflammation, brain vascular dysfunction, altered brain metabolism, neurotransmitter imbalance and impaired neuronal network connectivity. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) is the most commonly used diagnostic system upon which a reference standard diagnosis is made, although many other delirium screening tools have been developed given the impracticality of using the DSM-5 in many settings. Pharmacological treatments for delirium (such as antipsychotic drugs) are not effective, reflecting substantial gaps in our understanding of its pathophysiology. Currently, the best management strategies are multidomain interventions that focus on treating precipitating conditions, medication review, managing distress, mitigating complications and maintaining engagement to environmental issues. The effective implementation of delirium detection, treatment and prevention strategies remains a major challenge for health-c are organizations globally.},

Examples are given of how quantitative concepts in modern epidemiology influence the recognition of the causes of disease. The author uses the phenomenon of intensive swine production by vertically integrated agribusiness to illustrate how broad problems such as environmental racism, agricultural determinants of nutrition, loss of natural resources, and conditions conducive to emergence of new diseases are hidden by epidemiological approaches that fit into corporate policy perspectives.

Additionally functional outcome in patients after early craniectomy seems to be better than in patients without surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate the quality of life of patients who were treated with a decompressive craniectomy for severe ischemic stroke. Methods. We retrospectively investigated the patient records of 48 patients (26 men, mean age 48 years) suffering from ischemic strokes who underwent craniectomy since 1993. We registrated the preoperative neurological status, the diagnostic data as well as the operative procedure. The outcome was assessed using the Barthel Index, the Glasgow outcome score and a questionnaire to assess the quality of life according to Blau consisting of eleven items at follow-up. Findings. The mortality rate was 26\%, age correlated to mortality (44.5 versus 60.3 years GOS 1, mean, p {$<$} 0.0006). Craniectomy without dura patch correlated to mortality (58\% versus 14\% GOS 1 with dura patch, p {$<$} 0.005). The quality of life index was 6 points mean. The quality of life index did neither differ significantly between patients with left or right sided lesions nor in patients with and without aphasia. 83\% of the surviving patients and=or dependents would agree to surgery in the future. Conclusion. Despite the fact that some patients remain in a poor neurological condition, quality of life after decompressive surgery for ischemic stroke seems to be acceptable to the patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Specialty drugs are used to treat complex or life-threatening conditions, often at high financial costs to both patients and health plans. Three states \textemdash{} Delaware, Louisiana, and Maryland \textemdash{} passed legislation to cap out-of-pocket payments for specialty drugs at \$150 per prescription. A concern is that these caps could shift costs to health plans, increasing insurance premiums. Estimates of the effect of the caps on patient and health-plan spending could inform future policies. METHODS We analyzed a sample that included 27,161 persons under 65 years of age who had rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, hepatitis C, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis and who were in commercial health plans from 2011 through 2016 that were administered by three large nationwide insurers. The primary outcome was the change in out-of-pocket spending among specialty-drug users who were in the 95th percentile for spending on specialty drugs. Other outcomes were changes in mean out-of-pocket and health-plan spending for specialty drugs, nonspecialty drugs, and nondrug health care and utilization of specialty drugs. We compared outcomes in the three states that enacted caps with neighboring control states that did not, 3 years before and up to 3 years after enactment of the spending cap. RESULTS Caps were associated with an adjusted change in out-of-pocket costs of -\$351 (95\% confidence interval, -554 to -148) per specialty-drug user per month, representing a 32\% reduction in spending, among users in the 95th percentile of spending on specialty drugs. This finding was supported by multiple sensitivity analyses. Caps were not associated with changes in other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Caps for spending on specialty drugs were associated with substantial reductions in spending on specialty drugs among patients with the highest out-of-pocket costs, without detectable increases in health-plan spending, a proxy for future insurance premiums.

  abstract = {Background Patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) require mechanical ventilation to maintain arterial oxygenation, but this treatment may produce secondary lung injury. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) may reduce this secondary damage. Methods In a multicenter study, we randomly assigned adults requiring mechanical ventilation for ARDS to undergo either HFOV with a Novalung R100 ventilator (Metran) or usual ventilatory care. All the patients had a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of 200 mm Hg (26.7 kPa) or less and an expected duration of ventilation of at least 2 days. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality 30 days after randomization. Results There was no significant between-group difference in the primary outcome, which occurred in 166 of 398 patients (41.7\%) in the HFOV group and 163 of 397 patients (41.1\%) in the conventional-ventilation group (P\,=\,0.85 by the chi-square test). After adjustment for study center, sex, score on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, and the initial Pao2:Fio2 ratio, the odds ratio for survival in the conventional-ventilation group was 1.03 (95\% confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.40; P\,=\,0.87 by logistic regression).

  abstract = {Objective To assess the association of a chloride-restrictive (vs chloride-liberal) intravenous fluid strategy with AKI in critically ill patients. Design, Setting, and Patients Prospective, open-label, sequential period pilot study of 760 patients admitted consecutively to the intensive care unit (ICU) during the control period (February 18 to August 17, 2008) compared with 773 patients admitted consecutively during the intervention period (February 18 to August 17, 2009) at a university-affiliated hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Interventions During the control period, patients received standard intravenous fluids. After a 6-month phase-out period (August 18, 2008, to February 17, 2009), any use of chloride-rich intravenous fluids (0.9\% saline, 4\% succinylated gelatin solution, or 4\% albumin solution) was restricted to attending specialist approval only during the intervention period; patients instead received a lactated solution (Hartmann solution), a balanced solution (Plasma-Lyte 148), and chloride-poor 20\% albumin. Main Outcome Measures The primary outcomes included increase from baseline to peak creatinine level in the ICU and incidence of AKI according to the risk, injury, failure, loss, end-stage (RIFLE) classification. Secondary post hoc analysis outcomes included the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), length of stay in ICU and hospital, and survival. Results Chloride administration decreased by 144 504 mmol (from 694 to 496 mmol/ patient) from the control period to the intervention period. Comparing the control period with the intervention period, the mean serum creatinine level increase while in the ICU was 22.6 \textmu mol/L (95\% CI, 17.5-27.7 \textmu mol/L) vs 14.8 \textmu mol/L (95\% CI, 9.819.9 \textmu mol/L) (P=.03), the incidence of injury and failure class of RIFLE-defined AKI was 14\% (95\% CI, 11\%-16\%; n=105) vs 8.4\% (95\% CI, 6.4\%-10\%; n=65) (PϽ.001), and the use of RRT was 10\% (95\% CI, 8.1\%-12\%; n=78) vs 6.3\% (95\% CI, 4.6\%8.1\%; n=49) (P=.005). After adjustment for covariates, this association remained for incidence of injury and failure class of RIFLE-defined AKI (odds ratio, 0.52 [95\% CI, 0.37-0.75]; PϽ.001) and use of RRT (odds ratio, 0.52 [95\% CI, 0.33-0.81]; P=.004). There were no differences in hospital mortality, hospital or ICU length of stay, or need for RRT after hospital discharge. Conclusion The implementation of a chloride-restrictive strategy in a tertiary ICU was associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of AKI and use of RRT.

  abstract = {Background\hspace{0.6em} Patients with intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) are frequently transferred between hospitals for higher level of care. We aimed to identify factors associated with resource utilisation among patients with ICH admitted to a single academic hospital. Methods\hspace{0.6em} We used a prospectively collected registry of consecutive patients with primary ICH at an urban academic hospital between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2015. The primary outcome was use of either intensive care unit (ICU) admission or surgical intervention. Logistic regression examined factors associated with the outcome, controlling for age, sex, Glasgow coma score (GCS) and ICH score. Results\hspace{0.6em} Of the 2008 patients included, 887 (44.2\%) received ICU stay or surgical intervention. These patients were younger (71 vs 74 years, p{$<$}0.001), less often white (83.9\% vs 89.3\%, p{$<$}0.001), had lower baseline GCS (12 vs 14, p{$<$}0.001) and more frequently had intraventricular haemorrhage (58.6\% vs 43.4\%, p{$<$}0.001). Factors independently associated with ICU stay or surgical intervention were age {$>$}65 years (OR 0.38, 95\%\,CI 0.21 to 0.69), GCS {$<$}15 (1.23, 95\%\,CI 1.01 to 1.52) and ICH score {$>$}0 (OR 2.23, 95\%\,CI 1.70 to 2.91). Conclusion\hspace{0.6em} Among this cohort of primary patients with ICH, GCS of 15 and ICH score of 0 were associated with less frequent use of ICU or intervention. These results should be validated in a larger sample but may be valuable for hospitals considering which patients with ICH could safely remain at the referring facility.},

  abstract = {Objective: To assess physician prognosis and treatment recommendations for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and to determine the effect of providing physicians a validated prognostic score. Methods: A written survey with 2 ICH scenarios was completed by practicing neurologists and neurosurgeons. Selected factors were randomly varied (patient older vs middle age, Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score 7T vs 11, and presence vs absence of a validated prognostic score). Outcomes included predicted 30-day mortality and recommendations for initial treatment intensity (6-point scale ranging from 1 = comfort only to 6 = full treatment). Results: A total of 742 physicians were included (mean age 52, 32\% neurosurgeons, 17\% female). Physician predictions of 30-day mortality varied widely (mean [range] for the 4 possible combinations of age and GCS were 23\% [0\%\textendash 80\%], 35\% [0\%\textendash 100\%], 48\% [0\%\textendash 100\%], and 58\% [5\%\textendash 100\%]). Treatment recommendations also varied widely, with responses encompassing the full range of response options for each case. No physician demographic or personality characteristics were associated with treatment recommendations. Providing a prognostic score changed treatment recommendations, and the effect differed across cases. When the prognostic score suggested 0\% chance of functional independence (76-year-old with GCS 7T), the likelihood of treatment limitations was increased (odds ratio [OR] 1.61, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.12\textendash 2.33) compared to no prognostic score. Conversely, if the score suggested a 66\% chance of independence (63-year-old with GCS 11), treatment limitations were less likely (OR 0.62, 95\% CI 0.43\textendash 0.88). Conclusions: Physicians vary substantially in ICH prognostic estimates and treatment recommendations. This variability could have a profound effect on life and death decision-making and treatment for ICH.},

With advances in information technology and availability of electronic healthcare record, scoring systems of less commonly seen diseases and population can be developed. The aim of the article is to provide a tutorial on how to develop and validate risk scores based on a virtual dataset by using R software. The dataset we generated including numeric and categorical variables and firstly the numeric variables would be converted to factor variables according to cutoff points identified by the LOESS smoother. Then risk points of each variable, which are related to the coefficients in logistic regression, are assigned to each level of the converted factor variables and other categorical variables. Finally, the total score is calculated for each subject to represent the prediction of the outcome event probability. The original dataset is split into training and validation subsets. Discrimination and calibration are evaluated in the validation subset. R codes with explanations are presented in the main text.}
