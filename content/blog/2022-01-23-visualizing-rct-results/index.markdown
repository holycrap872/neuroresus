excerpt: 'INTERACT-2 was the first large, multicenter randomized trial to evaluate the effect of rapidly lowering blood pressure to a specific target in patients presenting with acute intracerebral hemorrhage within 6 hours of symptom onset. 2839 patients were randomized to achieve a blood pressure target of < 180 mm Hg (at that time, guideline-based treatment) or < 140 mm Hg (intensive blood pressure control).

At 90 days, 55.6% of patients in the guideline-recommended group were dead or severely disabled, compared to 52% of patients in the intensive-treatment group. This translated to an **OR 0.87 (95% CI 0.75 - 1.01)** in favor of the intensive-treatment group. This data is consistent with up to a 1% increase or a 25% decrease in the risk of death or major disability.'

# INTERACT-2 Visualization



First we have the plot for the mRS at 90 days.
Things still to tweak:

- Dotted lines in between bars to indicate the differences between various cutpoints on the mRS
- Adding table on the bottom with odds ratios of primary outcome cutoff vs. other cutoffs?
- Ultimately may be better to add a tabbed format to display p-value functions
