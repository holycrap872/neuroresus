  abstract = {Rates of survival with functional recovery for both in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest are notably low. Extra-corporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is emerging as a modality to improve prognosis by augmenting per-fusion to vital end-organs by utilizing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during conventional CPR and stabilizing the patient for interventions aimed at reversing the aetiology of the arrest. Implementing this emergent procedure requires a substantial investment in resources, and even the most successful ECPR programs may nonethe-less burden healthcare systems, clinicians, patients, and their families with unsalvageable patients supported by extra-corporeal devices. Non-randomized and observational studies have repeatedly shown an association between ECPR and improved survival, versus conventional CPR, for in-hospital cardiac arrest in select patient populations. Recently, randomized controlled trials suggest benefit for ECPR over standard resuscitation, as well as the feasibility of perform-ing such trials, in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest within highly coordinated healthcare delivery systems. Application of these data to clinical practice should be done cautiously, with outcomes likely to vary by the setting and system within which ECPR is initiated. ECPR introduces important ethical challenges, including whether it should be con-sidered an extension of CPR, at what point it becomes sustained organ replacement therapy, and how to approach patients unable to recover or be bridged to heart replacement therapy. The economic impact of ECPR varies by health system, and has the potential to outstrip resources if used indiscriminately. Ideally, studies should include economic evaluations to inform health care systems about the cost-benefits of this therapy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: All of Us is a novel research program that aims to accelerate research in populations traditionally underrepresented in biomedical research. Our objective was to evaluate the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in broadly defined underrepresented groups. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the latest data release of All of Us. We conducted a cross-\-sectional analysis combining survey and electronic health record data to estimate the prevalence of CVD upon enrollment in underrepresented groups defined by race, ethnicity, age ({$>$}75 years), disability (not able to carry out everyday physical activities), sexual orientation and gender identity lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual (LGBTQIA+), income (annual household income {$<\$$}35 000 US dollars) and education (less than a high school degree). We used multivariate logistic regression to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (OR) and product terms to test for interaction. The latest All of Us data release includes 315 297 participants. Of these, 230 577 (73\%) had information on CVD and 17 958 had CVD (overall prevalence, 7.8\%; 95\% CI, 7.7\textendash\- 7.9). Multivariate analyses adjusted by hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, body mass index, and smoking indicated that, compared with White participants, Black participants had a higher adjusted odds of CVD (OR, 1.21; 95\% CI, 1.16\textendash\-1.27). Higher adjusted odds of CVD were also observed in underrepresented groups defined by other factors, including age {$>$}75 years (OR, 1.90; 95\% CI, 1.81\textendash\-1.99), disability (OR, 1.60; 95\% CI, 1.53\textendash\-1.68), and income {$<\$$}35 000 US dollars (OR, 1.22; 95\% CI, 1.17\textendash\-1.27). Sex significantly modified the odds of CVD in several of the evaluated groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among participants enrolled in All of Us, underrepresented groups defined based on race, ethnicity and other factors have a disproportionately high burden of CVD. The All of Us research program constitutes a powerful platform to accelerate research focused on individuals in underrepresented groups.},

The aim of this policy statement is to provide a comprehensive review of the scientific evidence evaluating stroke systems of care to date and to update the American Stroke Association recommendations on the basis of improvements in stroke systems of care. Over the past decade, stroke systems of care have seen vast improvements in endovascular therapy, neurocritical care, and stroke center certification, in addition to the advent of innovations, such as telestroke and mobile stroke units, in the context of significant changes in the organization of healthcare policy in the United States. This statement provides an update to prior publications to help guide policymakers and public healthcare agencies in continually updating their stroke systems of care in light of these changes. This statement and its recommendations span primordial and primary prevention, acute stroke recognition and activation of emergency medical services, triage to appropriate facilities, designation of and treatment at stroke centers, secondary prevention at hospital discharge, and rehabilitation and recovery.}

Objectives: We tested the hypothesis that blinded analysts applying target trial emulation to existing observational data could predict the results of an RCT. Methods: PreVent (Preventing Hypoxemia with Manual Ventilation during Endotracheal Intubation) was a multicenter RCT examining the effects of positive-pressure ventilation during tracheal intubation on oxygen saturation and severe hypoxemia. Analysts unaware of PreVent's results used patient-level data from three previous trials evaluating airway management interventions to emulate PreVent's eligibility criteria, randomization procedure, and statistical analysis. After PreVent's release, results of this blinded observational analysis were compared with those of the RCT. Difference-in-differences estimates for comparison of treatment effects between the observational analysis and the PreVent trial are reported on the absolute scale.},

This review highlights the emerging evidence on critical care nutrition and focuses on the pathophysiologic interplay between critical illness, the gastrointestinal tract, and nutrition support and the evidence on the best route, dose, and timing of nutrition. Although indirect calorimetry is recommended to measure energy expenditure, predictive equations are commonly used but are limited by their inaccuracy in individual patients. The current evidence supports early enteral nutrition (EN) in most patients, with a gradual increase in the daily dose over the first week. Delayed EN is warranted in patients with severe shock. According to recent trials, parenteral nutrition seems to be as effective as EN and may be started if adequate EN is not achieved by the first week of critical illness. A high protein dose has been recommended, but the best timing is unclear. Immuno-nutrition should not be routinely provided to critically ill patients. Patients receiving artificial nutrition should be monitored for metabolic derangements. Additional adequately powered studies are still needed to resolve many unanswered questions.},

  abstract = {Background and purpose: Historically, overall outcomes for patients with high-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) have been poor. Generally, between physicians, either reluctance to treat, or selectivity in treating such patients has been the paradigm. Recent studies have shown that early and aggressive care leads to significant improvement in survival rates and favorable outcomes of grade V SAH patients. With advancements in both neurocritical care and end-of-life care, nontreatment or selective treatment of grade V SAH patients is rarely justified. Current paradigm shifts towards early and aggressive care in such cases may lead to improved outcomes for many more patients. Materials and methods: We performed a detailed review of the current literature regarding neurointensive management strategies in high-grade SAH, discussing multiple aspects. We discussed the neurointensive care management protocols for grade V SAH patients. Results: Acutely, intracranial pressure control is of utmost importance with external ventricular drain placement, sedation, optimization of cerebral perfusion pressure, osmotherapy and hyperventilation, as well as cardiopulmonary support through management of hypotension and hypertension. Conclusions: Advancements of care in SAH patients make it unethical to deny treatment to poor Hunt and Hess grade patients. Early and aggressive treatment results in a significant improvement in survival rate and favorable outcome in such patients.},

  abstract = {Background Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) demonstrated that tocilizumab reduces mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, substantial uncertainty remains whether tocilizumab's effect is similar across clinically relevant subgroups. Whether this uncertainty can be resolved with Bayesian methods is unknown. Design, Setting, Participants, and Interventions RECOVERY was a controlled, open-label, platform UK trial that randomized (1:1) 4116 adults with oxygen saturation {$<$}92\% on room air or receiving oxygen therapy with C-reactive protein {$\geq$}75 mg/L to either usual care or tocilizumab plus usual care. Main outcome measures Mortality and hospital discharge within 28 days. Methods Using Bayesian methods, we combined RECOVERY with evidence-based priors incorporating previous COVID-19 tocilizumab RCTs. The probability of tocilizumab's benefit for respiratory support and corticosteroid subgroups and sensitivity analyses were performed with different prior distributions and baseline risks. Results For all-cause mortality, the posterior probabilities of decreased deaths with tocilizumab were {$>$}99\% and 19\% in patients using and not using corticosteroids, respectively. In patients on simple oxygen only, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, the probabilities of decreased mortality were 96\%, {$>$}99\% and 77\%, respectively. The probabilities for a clinically significant mortality reduction, as assessed by an absolute risk difference {$>$} 3\% (number needed to treat {$\leq$} 33), were 77\%, 96\%, 56\%, respectively. Sensitivity analyses highlighted the uncertainty and lack of conclusive evidence for tocilizumab's effect in patients on invasive mechanical ventilation and those without concurrent corticosteroids. Posterior probabilities of benefit for hospital discharge outcome were high and consistent across most subgroups. Conclusions In this Bayesian reanalysis, COVID-19 hospitalized patients exposed to corticosteroids or on non-invasive ventilation have a high probability of a clinically meaningful mortality benefit from tocilizumab. Tocilizumab also likely improves discharge from hospital in most subgroups. Future research should further address if patients on invasive mechanical ventilation can also benefit from tocilizumab.},

Based on these needs, we tested the following step-down unit admission criteria: Supratentorial ICH, ICH volume {$<$}20 cc, no Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), systolic BP {$<$}200mmHg, no respiratory failure, GCS{$\geq$}12. We classified 431 patients into two groups; 1-Patients who met step-down unit admission Criteria (71 patients). 2-Patients who didn't meet the criteria (360 patients).ResultsIn our patients, 16.5\% fulfilled the criteria. Length of stay in the ICU was 1.43days in step-down unit admission criteria patients. None of the patients who fulfilled the criteria were readmitted to the ICU, compared to 3 readmissions among the group of patients who did not fulfill the criteria (P=0.82). None of these patients required a neurosurgical procedure vs 47 patients (10.9\%) in the other group (P=0.04). Among patients who met the criteria, 83.1\% were discharged home or rehab RR 0.33 CI (0.19\textendash 0.55), (P{$<$}0.0001).ConclusionWe propose that patients who fulfill step-down unit admission criteria can be safely monitored in stroke unit and they have no need for ICU admission.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vasospasm is a treatable cause of deterioration following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral computed tomography perfusion mean transit times have been proposed as a predictor of vasospasm but suffer from well-\- known technical limitations. We evaluated fully automated, thresholded time-\-to-\-maxima of the tissue residue function (Tmax) for determination of vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective analysis of 540 arterial segments from 36 encounters in 31 consecutive patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage undergoing computed tomography angiography (CTA), computed tomography perfusion, and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) within 24 hours. Tmax at 4, 6, 8, and 10 s was generated using RAPID (iSchemaView Inc., Menlo Park, CA). Dual-\-reader CTA and computed tomography perfusion interpretations were compared for patients with and without vasospasm on DSA (DSA+ and DSA-). Logistic regression models were developed using CTA and Tmax as input predictors and DSA vasospasm as outcome in adjusted and unadjusted models. Imaging studies from all 31 subjects (mean age 47.3{$\pm$}11.1, 77\% female, 65\% with single aneurysm with mean size of 6.0{$\pm$}2.9 mm) were included. Vasospasm was identified in 42 segments on DSA and 59 segments on CTA, with significant associations across individual vessel segments (P{$<$}0.001). In adjusted analyses, DSA vasospasm was associated with CTA (odds ratio [OR], 2.43; 95\% CI, 0.94\textendash\-6.32; P=0.068) as well as territory-\-specific Tmax{$>$}6 seconds delays (OR, 3.57; 95\% CI, 1.36\textendash\-9.35; P=0.009). Sensitivity/ specificity for DSA vasospasm was 31\%/91\% for CTA, 26\%/89\% for Tmax{$>$}6 seconds, and 12\%/99\% for CTA+Tmax{$>$}6 seconds. CONCLUSIONS: CTA and Tmax offer high specificity for presence of vasospasm; their utility, even in combination, as screening tests is, however, limited by poor sensitivity.},

Randomised controlled clinical trials that do not show a significant difference between the treatments being compared are often called ``negative.'' This term wrongly implies that the study has shown that there is no difference, whereas usually all that has been shown is an absence of evidence of a difference. These are quite different statements. The sample size of controlled trials is generally inadequate, with a consequent lack of power to detect real, and clinically worthwhile, differences in treatment.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The role of regional hypoperfusion as a contributor to stroke risk in atherosclerotic vertebrobasilar disease has recently been confirmed by the observational VERiTAS (Vertebrobasilar Flow Evaluation and Risk of Transient Ischemic Attack and Stroke) Study. We examined the stability of hemodynamic status over time and its relationship to stroke risk in patients from this prospective cohort. METHODS: VERiTAS enrolled patients with recently symptomatic {$\geq$}50\% atherosclerotic stenosis/occlusion of vertebral and/or basilar arteries. Large vessel flow in the vertebrobasilar territory was assessed using quantitative magnetic resonance angiography, and patients were designated as low or normal flow based on distal territory regional flow, incorporating collateral capacity. Patients underwent standard medical management and follow-up for primary outcome event of vertebrobasilar territory stroke. Quantitative magnetic resonance angiography imaging was repeated at 6, 12, and 24 months. Flow status over time was examined relative to baseline and relative to subsequent stroke risk using a cause-specific proportional hazard model, with flow status treated as a time-varying covariate. Mean blood pressure was examined to assess for association with changes in flow status. RESULTS: Over 19{$\pm$}8 months of follow-up, 132 follow-up quantitative magnetic resonance angiography studies were performed in 58 of the 72 enrolled patients. Of the 13 patients with serial imaging who had low flow at baseline, 7 (54\%) had improvement to normal flow at the last follow-up. Of the 45 patients who had normal flow at baseline, 3 (7\%) converted to low flow at the last follow-up. The mean blood pressure did not differ in patients with or without changes in flow status. The time-varying flow status remained a strong predictor of subsequent stroke (hazard ratio, 10.3 [95\% CI, 2.2\textendash 48.7]). CONCLUSIONS: There is potential both for improvement and worsening of hemodynamics in patients with atherosclerotic vertebrobasilar disease. Flow status, both at baseline and over time, is a risk factor for subsequent stroke, thus serving as an important prognostic marker.},

A major problem is that we tend to take small               p               -values at face value, but mistrust results with larger               p               -values. In either case,               p               -values tell little about reliability of research, because they are hardly replicable even if an alternative hypothesis is true. Also significance (               p               ~{$\leq~$}0.05) is hardly replicable: at a good statistical power of 80\%, two studies will be `conflicting', meaning that one is significant and the other is not, in one third of the cases if there is a true effect. A replication can therefore not be interpreted as having failed only because it is nonsignificant. Many apparent replication failures may thus reflect faulty judgment based on significance thresholds rather than a crisis of unreplicable research. Reliable conclusions on replicability and practical importance of a finding can only be drawn using cumulative evidence from multiple independent studies. However, applying significance thresholds makes cumulative knowledge unreliable. One reason is that with anything but ideal statistical power, significant effect sizes will be biased upwards. Interpreting inflated significant results while ignoring nonsignificant results will thus lead to wrong conclusions. But current incentives to hunt for significance lead to selective reporting and to publication bias against nonsignificant findings. Data dredging,               p               -hacking, and publication bias should be addressed by removing fixed significance thresholds. Consistent with the recommendations of the late Ronald Fisher,               p               -values should be interpreted as graded measures of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. Also larger               p               -values offer some evidence against the null hypothesis, and they cannot be interpreted as supporting the null hypothesis, falsely concluding that `there is no effect'. Information on possible true effect sizes that are compatible with the data must be obtained from the point estimate, e.g., from a sample average, and from the interval estimate, such as a confidence interval. We review how confusion about interpretation of larger               p               -values can be traced back to historical disputes among the founders of modern statistics. We further discuss potential arguments against removing significance thresholds, for example that decision rules should rather be more stringent, that sample sizes could decrease, or that               p               -values should better be completely abandoned. We conclude that whatever method of statistical inference we use, dichotomous threshold thinking must give way to non-automated informed judgment.},

  abstract = {Statistical inference often fails to replicate. One reason is that many results may be selected for drawing inference because some threshold of a statistic like the P-value was crossed, leading to biased reported effect sizes. Nonetheless, considerable non-replication is to be expected even without selective reporting, and generalizations from single studies are rarely if ever warranted. Honestly reported results must vary from replication to replication because of varying assumption violations and random variation; excessive agreement itself would suggest deeper problems, such as failure to publish results in conflict with group expectations or desires. A general perception of a ``replication crisis'' may thus reflect failure to recognize that statistical tests not only test hypotheses, but countless assumptions and the entire environment in which research takes place. Because of all the uncertain and unknown assumptions that underpin statistical inferences, we should treat inferential statistics as highly unstable local descriptions of relations between assumptions and data, rather than as providing generalizable inferences about hypotheses or models. And that means we should treat statistical results as being much more incomplete and uncertain than is currently the norm. Acknowledging this uncertainty could help reduce the allure of selective reporting: Since a small P-value could be large in a replication study, and a large P-value could be small, there is simply no need to selectively report studies based on statistical results. Rather than focusing our study reports on uncertain conclusions, we should thus focus on describing accurately how the study was conducted, what problems occurred, what data were obtained, what analysis methods were used and why, and what output those methods produced.},

  abstract = {Background Whether rapid lowering of elevated blood pressure would improve the outcome in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage is not known. Methods We randomly assigned 2839 patients who had had a spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage within the previous 6 hours and who had elevated systolic blood pressure to receive intensive treatment to lower their blood pressure (with a target systolic level of {$<$}140 mm Hg within 1 hour) or guideline-recommended treatment (with a target systolic level of {$<$}180 mm Hg) with the use of agents of the physician's choosing. The primary outcome was death or major disability, which was defined as a score of 3 to 6 on the modified Rankin scale (in which a score of 0 indicates no symptoms, a score of 5 indicates severe disability, and a score of 6 indicates death) at 90 days. A prespecified ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin score was also performed. The rate of serious adverse events was compared between the two groups. Results Among the 2794 participants for whom the primary outcome could be determined, 719 of 1382 participants (52.0\%) receiving intensive treatment, as compared with 785 of 1412 (55.6\%) receiving guideline-recommended treatment, had a primary outcome event (odds ratio with intensive treatment, 0.87; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 1.01; P\,=\,0.06). The ordinal analysis showed significantly lower modified Rankin scores with intensive treatment (odds ratio for greater disability, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.77 to 1.00; P\,=\,0.04). Mortality was 11.9\% in the group receiving intensive treatment and 12.0\% in the group receiving guideline-recommended treatment. Nonfatal serious adverse events occurred in 23.3\% and 23.6\% of the patients in the two groups, respectively. The authors' affiliations are listed in the Appendix.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is a common condition in the ICU. Despite much research, its prognosis remains poor. In 2017, a retrospective before/after study reported promising results using a combination of thiamine, ascorbic acid, and hydrocortisone called ``metabolic resuscitation cocktail'' and several randomized controlled trials assessing its effectiveness were performed. DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in septic ICU patients to assess the effects of this combination therapy. SETTING: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library databases were searched from inception to March of 2021. Data were extracted independently by two authors. The main outcome was the change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score within 72 hours. Secondary outcomes included renal composite endpoints (acute kidney injury) Kidney Disease - Improving Global Outcome organization stage 3 or need for renal replacement therapy, vasopressor duration, and 28-day mortality. SUBJECTS: We included randomized controlled trials with patients admitted to the ICU with sepsis or septic shock. INTERVENTION: The trials compared a combination of thiamine, ascorbic acid, and hydrocortisone to standard care or placebo in patients admitted to ICU with sepsis or septic shock. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included eight randomized controlled trials (n = 1,335 patients). Within 72 hours, the median of mean improvement was \textendash 1.8 and \textendash 3.2 in the control and intervention groups, respectively (eight randomized controlled trials, n = 1,253 patients); weighted mean difference \textendash 0.82 (95\% CI, \textendash 1.15 to \textendash 0.48). Data were homogeneous and the funnel plot did not suggest any publication bias. Duration of vasopressor requirement was significantly reduced in the intervention group (six randomized controlled trials). There was no evidence of a difference regarding the ICU mortality and the renal composite outcome (acute kidney injury KDIGO 3 or need for renal replacement therapy, seven randomized controlled trials). CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic resuscitation cocktail administrated in ICU septic patients improves change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score within 72 hours. However, this improvement is modest and its clinical relevance is questionable. The impact on renal failure and mortality remains unclear.},

To develop a guide to support medical educators' process of educational diagnosis and management in this area. Methods: We used a participatory action research method. We carried out eight iterative reflective cycles with a group of clinical teachers. The repeated phases of experimentation and observation were conducted by participants in their own clinical teaching setting. Our findings were tested and validated on both an individual and collective basis Results: We found five categories of clinical reasoning difficulties as they present in the clinical teaching settings. We identified indicators for each. Indicators may be different depending on the type of supervision. These findings were assembled and organized to construct a guide for clinical teachers. Conclusions: The guide should assist clinical teachers in detecting clinical reasoning difficulties during clinical teaching and in providing remediation that is tailored to the specific difficulty identified. Its development furthers our understanding of clinical reasoning difficulties and provides a useful tool.},

Because of the multifactorial pathophysiology of DCI, methodologies solely assessing blood vessel narrowing (vasospasm) are insufficient to detect all DCI. Quantitative EEG has facilitated the exploration of EEG as a diagnostic modality of DCI. Multiple quantitative EEG parameters such as alpha power, relative alpha variability, and alpha/delta ratio show reliable detection of DCI in multiple studies. Recent studies on epileptiform abnormalities suggest that their potential for the detection of DCI. Quantitative EEG is a promising, continuous, noninvasive, monitoring modality of DCI implementable in daily practice. Future work should validate these parameters in larger populations, facilitated by the development of automated detection algorithms and multimodal data integration.},

Therapeutic hypothermia is a robust and well-studied neuroprotectant widely used across a variety of specialties.                                         Aims               This review summarizes results from preclinical and clinical studies to highlight the overall effectiveness of therapeutic hypothermia to improve long-term intracerebral hemorrhage outcomes while also elucidating optimal protocol regimens to maximize therapeutic effect.                                         Summary of review               A systematic review was conducted across three databases to identify trials investigating the use of therapeutic hypothermia to treat intracerebral hemorrhage. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted on preclinical studies, looking at neurobehavioral outcomes, blood brain barrier breakdown, cerebral edema, hematoma volume, and tissue loss. Several mixed-methods meta-regression models were also performed to adjust for variance and variations in hypothermia induction procedures. Twwenty-one preclinical studies and five human studies were identified. The meta-analysis of preclinical studies demonstrated a significant benefit in behavioral scores (ES\,=\,-0.43, p\,=\,0.02), cerebral edema (ES\,=\,1.32, p\,=\,0.0001), and blood brain barrier (ES\,=\,2.73, p\,{$\leq$}\,0.00001). Therapeutic hypothermia was not found to significantly affect hematoma expansion (ES\,=\,-0.24, p\,=\,0.12) or tissue loss (ES\,=\,0.06, p\,=\,0.68). Clinical study outcome reporting was heterogeneous; however, there was recurring evidence of therapeutic hypothermia-induced edema reduction.                                         Conclusions               The combined preclinical evidence demonstrates that therapeutic hypothermia reduced multiple cell death mechanisms initiated by intracerebral hemorrhage; yet, there is no definitive evidence in clinical studies. The cooling strategies employed in both preclinical and clinical studies were highly diverse, and focused refinement of cooling protocols should be developed in future preclinical studies. The current data for therapeutic hypothermia in intracerebral hemorrhage remains questionable despite the highly promising indications in preclinical studies. Definitive randomized controlled studies are still required to answer this therapeutic question.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Preapproval trials showed that messenger RNA (mRNA)\textendash based vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had a good safety profile, yet these trials were subject to size and patient-mix limitations. An evaluation of the safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine with respect to a broad range of potential adverse events is needed. METHODS We used data from the largest health care organization in Israel to evaluate the safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. For each potential adverse event, in a population of persons with no previous diagnosis of that event, we individually matched vaccinated persons to unvaccinated persons according to sociodemographic and clinical variables. Risk ratios and risk differences at 42 days after vaccination were derived with the use of the Kaplan\textendash Meier estimator. To place these results in context, we performed a similar analysis involving SARS-CoV-2\textendash infected persons matched to uninfected persons. The same adverse events were studied in the vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection analyses. The authors' affiliations are listed in the Appendix.

RESULTS In the vaccination analysis, the vaccinated and control groups each included a mean of 884,828 persons. Vaccination was most strongly associated with an elevated risk of myocarditis (risk ratio, 3.24; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.55 to 12.44; risk difference, 2.7 events per 100,000 persons; 95\% CI, 1.0 to 4.6), lymphadenopathy (risk ratio, 2.43; 95\% CI, 2.05 to 2.78; risk difference, 78.4 events per 100,000 persons; 95\% CI, 64.1 to 89.3), appendicitis (risk ratio, 1.40; 95\% CI, 1.02 to 2.01; risk difference, 5.0 events per 100,000 persons; 95\% CI, 0.3 to 9.9), and herpes zoster infection (risk ratio, 1.43; 95\% CI, 1.20 to 1.73; risk difference, 15.8 events per 100,000 persons; 95\% CI, 8.2 to 24.2). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a substantially increased risk of myocarditis (risk ratio, 18.28; 95\% CI, 3.95 to 25.12; risk difference, 11.0 events per 100,000 persons; 95\% CI, 5.6 to 15.8) and of additional serious adverse events, including pericarditis, arrhythmia, deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, and thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS In this study in a nationwide mass vaccination setting, the BNT162b2 vaccine was not associated with an elevated risk of most of the adverse events examined. The vaccine was associated with an excess risk of myocarditis (1 to 5 events per 100,000 persons). The risk of this potentially serious adverse event and of many other serious adverse events was substantially increased after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

  abstract = {Background/Objective:\hspace{0.6em} Desmopressin (DDAVP) has been suggested for antiplatelet medication reversal in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) but there are limited data describing its effect on clinical outcomes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of DDAVP on hematoma expansion and thrombosis in patients with TBI who were prescribed pre-injury antiplatelet medications. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} Consecutive adult patients who were admitted to our level I trauma center and prescribed pre-injury antiplatelet medications between July, 2012, and May, 2018, were retrospectively identified. Patients were excluded if their hospital length of stay was\,{$<$}\,24 h, if DDAVP was administered by any route other than intravenous, if they received a DDAVP dose\,{$<$}\,0.3 mcg/kg or there was no evidence of brain hemorrhage on computed tomography (CT) scan. Patients were stratified based on the use of DDAVP, and the incidence of hematoma expansion was compared between groups. Thrombotic events were reviewed as a secondary outcome. Multivariate analysis was utilized to control for confounding variables. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Of 202 patients included in analysis, 158 (78\%) received DDAVP. The mean age was 76\,{$\pm$}\,12 years; the most common injury mechanism was falls (76\%); 69\% had acute subdural hematoma, and 49\% had multi-compartmental hemorrhage. Initial Glasgow coma score was between 13 and 15 for 91\% of patients. Aspirin was the most common antiplatelet regimen prescribed (N\,=\,151, 75\%), followed by dual antiplatelet regimens (N\,=\,26, 13\%) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-receptor inhibitors (N\,=\,25, 12\%). The incidence of hematoma expansion was 14\% and 30\% for patients who did and did not receive DDAVP, respectively (p\,=\,0.015). After controlling for age, injury severity score, multi-compartmental hemorrhage, and receipt of pre-injury high-dose aspirin ({$>$}\,81 mg), ADP-receptor inhibitors, oral anticoagulants, prothrombin complex concentrates or platelets in a multivariate analysis, the association between DDAVP and hematoma expansion remained significant (adjusted OR 0.259 [95\% CI 0.103\textendash 0.646], p\,=\,0.004). Throm-botic events were similar between the two groups (DDAVP, 2.5\%, no DDAVP, 4.5\%; p\,=\,0.613). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} DDAVP was associated with a lower incidence of hematoma expansion in patients with mild TBI who were prescribed pre-injury antiplatelet medications. These results justify a randomized controlled trial to further evalu-ate the role of DDAVP for this indication.},

Methods To develop and validate these risk equations, we used data from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes study (ACCORD, n=9635; 2001\textendash 09) and validated the equations for microvascular events using data from the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS, n=1018; 1996\textendash 2001), and for cardiovascular events using data from the Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD, n=4760; 2001\textendash 12). Microvascular outcomes were nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Cardiovascular outcomes were myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, and cardiovascular mortality. We also included all-cause mortality as an outcome. We used a cross-validating machine learning method to select predictor variables from demographic characteristics, clinical variables, comorbidities, medications, and biomarkers into Cox proportional hazards models for each outcome. The new equations were compared to older risk equations by assessing model discrimination, calibration, and the net reclassification index. Findings All equations had moderate internal and external discrimination (C-statistics 0{$\cdot$}55\textendash 0{$\cdot$}84 internally, 0{$\cdot$}57\textendash 0{$\cdot$}79 externally) and high internal and external calibration (slopes 0{$\cdot$}71\textendash 1{$\cdot$}31 between observed and estimated risk). Our equations had better discrimination and calibration than the UK Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model 2 (for microvascular and cardiovascular outcomes, C-statistics 0{$\cdot$}54\textendash 0{$\cdot$}62, slopes 0{$\cdot$}06\textendash 1{$\cdot$}12) and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Pooled Cohort Equations (for fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke, C-statistics 0{$\cdot$}61\textendash 0{$\cdot$}66, slopes 0{$\cdot$}30\textendash 0{$\cdot$}39). Interpretation RECODe might improve estimation of risk of complications for patients with type 2 diabetes.

  abstract = {Researchers commonly use p-values to answer the question: How strongly does the evidence favor the alternative hypothesis relative to the null hypothesis? p-Values themselves do not directly answer this question and are often misinterpreted in ways that lead to overstating the evidence against the null hypothesis. Even in the ``post p {$<$} 0.05 era,'' however, it is quite possible that p-values will continue to be widely reported and used to assess the strength of evidence (if for no other reason than the widespread availability and use of statistical software that routinely produces p-values and thereby implicitly advocates for their use). If so, the potential for misinterpretation will persist. In this article, we recommend three practices that would help researchers more accurately interpret p-values. Each of the three recommended practices involves interpreting p-values in light of their corresponding ``Bayes factor bound,'' which is the largest odds in favor of the alternative hypothesis relative to the null hypothesis that is consistent with the observed data. The Bayes factor bound generally indicates that a given p-value provides weaker evidence against the null hypothesis than typically assumed. We therefore believe that our recommendations can guard against some of the most harmful p-value misinterpretations. In research communities that are deeply attached to reliance on ``p {$<$} 0.05,'' our recommendations will serve as initial steps away from this attachment. We emphasize that our recommendations are intended merely as initial, temporary steps and that many further steps will need to be taken to reach the ultimate destination: a holistic interpretation of statistical evidence that fully conforms to the principles laid out in the ASA statement on statistical significance and p-values.},

Methods We mapped an atlas of arousal nuclei in the brainstem, thalamus, hypothalamus, and basal forebrain onto 3 tesla susceptibility-weighted images (SWI) in 12 patients with acute severe TBI who presented in coma and recovered consciousness within 6 months. We assessed the spatial distribution and volume of SWI microbleeds and evaluated the association of microbleed volume with the duration of unresponsiveness and functional recovery at 6 months. Results There was no single arousal nucleus affected by microbleeds in all patients. Rather, multiple combinations of microbleeds in brainstem, thalamic, and hypothalamic arousal nuclei were associated with coma and were compatible with recovery of consciousness. Microbleeds were frequently detected in the midbrain (100\%), thalamus (83\%), and pons (75\%). Within the brainstem, the microbleed incidence was largest within the mesopontine tegmentum (e.g., pedunculotegmental nucleus, mesencephalic reticular formation) and ventral midbrain (e.g., substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area). Brainstem arousal nuclei were partially affected by microbleeds, with microbleed volume not exceeding 35\% of brainstem nucleus volume on average. Compared to microbleed volume within nonarousal brainstem regions, the microbleed volume within arousal brainstem nuclei accounted for a larger proportion of variance in the duration of unresponsiveness and 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale\textendash Extended scores. Conclusion These results suggest resilience of arousal mechanisms in the human brain after severe TBI.},

  abstract = {Demand for intensive care unit (ICU) resources often exceeds supply, and shortages of ICU beds and staff are likely to persist. Triage requires careful weighing of the benefits and risks involved in ICU admission while striving to guarantee fair distribution of available resources. We must ensure that the patients who occupy ICU beds are those most likely to benefit from the ICU's specialized technology and professionals. Although prognosticating is not an exact science, preference should be given to patients who are more likely to survive if admitted to the ICU but unlikely to survive or likely to have more significant morbidity if not admitted. To provide general guidance for intensivists in ICU triage decisions, a task force of the World Federation of Societies of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine addressed 4 basic questions regarding this process. The team made recommendations and concluded that triage should be led by intensivists considering input from nurses, emergency medicine professionals, hospitalists, surgeons, and allied professionals. Triage algorithms and protocols can be useful but can never supplant the role of skilled intensivists basing their decisions on input from multidisciplinary teams. Infrastructures need to be organized efficiently both within individual hospitals and at the regional level. When resources are critically limited, patients may be refused ICU admission if others may benefit more on the basis of the principle of distributive justice.}

  abstract = {Purpose:\hspace{0.6em} Hyperglycaemia is an adaptive response to stress commonly observed in critical illness. Its management remains debated in the intensive care unit (ICU). Individualising hyperglycaemia management, by targeting the patient's pre-admission usual glycaemia, could improve outcome. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} In a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, critically-ill adults were considered for inclusion. Patients underwent until ICU discharge either individualised glucose control by targeting the pre-admission usual glycaemia using the glycated haemoglobin A1c level at ICU admission (IC group), or conventional glucose control by maintaining glycaemia below 180 mg/dL (CC group). A non-commercial web application of a dynamic sliding-scale insulin protocol gave to nurses all instructions for glucose control in both groups. The primary outcome was death within 90 days. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Owing to a low likelihood of benefit and evidence of the possibility of harm related to hypoglycaemia, the study was stopped early. 2075 patients were randomized; 1917 received the intervention, 942 in the IC group and 975 in the CC group. Although both groups showed significant differences in terms of glycaemic control, survival proba-bility at 90-day was not significantly different (IC group: 67.2\%, 95\% CI [64.2\%; 70.3\%]; CC group: 69.6\%, 95\% CI [66.7\%; 72.5\%]). Severe hypoglycaemia (below 40 mg/dL) occurred in 3.9\% of patients in the IC group and in 2.5\% of patients in the CC group (p\,=\,0.09). A post hoc analysis showed for non-diabetic patients a higher risk of 90-day mortality in the IC group compared to the CC group (HR 1.3, 95\% CI [1.05; 1.59], p\,=\,0.018).},

Methods               Following the 2013 review method, we assembled a group of 9 international experts on risk communication across Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We expanded the topics covered in the first review to reflect emerging areas of research. Groups of 2 to 3 authors reviewed the relevant literature based on their expertise and wrote each section before review by the full authorship team.                                         Results               Of 10 topics identified, we present 5 fundamental issues in this article. Although some topics resulted in clear guidance (presenting the chance an event will occur, addressing numerical skills), other topics (context/evaluative labels, conveying uncertainty, risk over time) continue to have evolving knowledge bases. We recommend presenting numbers over a set time period with a clear denominator, using consistent formats between outcomes and interventions to enable unbiased comparisons, and interpreting the numbers for the reader to meet the needs of varying numeracy.                                         Discussion               Understanding how different numerical formats can bias risk perception will help decision aid developers communicate risks in a balanced, comprehensible manner and avoid accidental ``nudging'' toward a particular option. Decisions between probability formats need to consider the available evidence and user skills. The review may be useful for other areas of science communication in which unbiased presentation of probabilities is important.},

Unknown HIV-positive disease status, antiretroviral drug resistance, poor drug compliance, and recreational drug abuse are factors that continue to influence the morbidity and mortality of infections. The clinical and radiographic pattern of CNS opportunistic infections is unique in the setting of HIV infection: opportunistic infections in HIV-positive patients often have characteristic clinical and radiological presentations that can differ from the presentation of opportunistic infections in immunocompetent patients and are often sufficient to establish the diagnosis. ART in the setting of these opportunistic infections can lead to a paradoxical worsening caused by an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). In this Review, we discuss several of the most common CNS opportunistic infections: cerebral toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leuko\- encephalopathy (PML), tuberculous meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis and cytomegalovirus infection, with an emphasis on clinical pearls, pathological findings, MRI findings and treatment. Moreover, we discuss the risk factors, pathophysiology and management of IRIS. We also summarize the challenges that remain in management of CNS opportunistic infections, which includes the lack of phase II and III clinical trials, absence of antimicrobials for infections such as PML, and controversy regarding the use of corticosteroids for treatment of IRIS.},

In this paper, we provide the first quasi-experimental estimates of the impact of social media on mental health by leveraging a unique natural experiment: the staggered introduction of Facebook across U.S. colleges. Our analysis couples data on student mental health around the years of Facebook's expansion with a generalized difference-in-differences empirical strategy. We find that the roll-out of Facebook at a college increased symptoms of poor mental health, especially depression, and led to increased utilization of mental healthcare services. We also find that, according to the students' reports, the decline in mental health translated into worse academic performance. Additional evidence on mechanisms suggests the results are due to Facebook fostering unfavorable social comparisons.},

We incorporated the FOUR Score into the existing ICH Score and evaluated its accuracy of risk assessment in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Materials and Methods Consecutive patients admitted to our institution from 2009 to 2012 with spontaneous ICH were reviewed. The ICH Score was calculated using patient age, hemorrhage location, hemorrhage volume, evidence of intraventricular extension, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The FOUR Score was then incorporated into the ICH Score as a substitute for the GCS (ICH ScoreFS). The ability of the 2 scores to predict mortality at 1 month was then compared. Results In total, 274 patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age was 73 years (interquartile range 60-82) and 138 (50.4\%) were male. Overall mortality at 1 month was 28.8\% (n\,=\,79). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was .91 for the ICH Score and .89 for the ICH ScoreFS. For ICH Scores of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, 1-month mortality was 4.2\%, 29.9\%, 62.5\%, 95.0\%, and 100\%. In the ICH ScoreFS model, mortality was 10.7\%, 26.5\%, 64.5\%, 88.9\%, and 100\% for scores of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between serotonergic antidepressant exposure during pregnancy and child autism spectrum disorder. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study. Health administrative data sets were used to study children born to mothers who were receiving public prescription drug coverage during pregnancy in Ontario, Canada, from 2002-2010, reflecting 4.2\% of births. Children were followed up until March 31, 2014. EXPOSURES Serotonergic antidepressant exposure was defined as 2 or more consecutive maternal prescriptions for a selective serotonin or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor between conception and delivery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Child autism spectrum disorder identified after the age of 2 years. Exposure group differences were addressed by inverse probability of treatment weighting based on derived high-dimensional propensity scores (computerized algorithm used to select a large number of potential confounders) and by comparing exposed children with unexposed siblings. RESULTS There were 35 906 singleton births at a mean gestational age of 38.7 weeks (50.4\% were male, mean maternal age was 26.7 years, and mean duration of follow-up was 4.95 years). In the 2837 pregnancies (7.9\%) exposed to antidepressants, 2.0\% (95\% CI, 1.6\%-2.6\%) of children were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. The incidence of autism spectrum disorder was 4.51 per 1000 person-years among children exposed to antidepressants vs 2.03 per 1000 person-years among unexposed children (between-group difference, 2.48 [95\% CI, 2.33-2.62] per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 2.16 [95\% CI, 1.64-2.86]; adjusted HR, 1.59 [95\% CI, 1.17-2.17]). After inverse probability of treatment weighting based on the high-dimensional propensity score, the association was not significant (HR, 1.61 [95\% CI, 0.997-2.59]). The association was also not significant when exposed children were compared with unexposed siblings (incidence of autism spectrum disorder was 3.40 per 1000 person-years vs 2.05 per 1000 person-years, respectively; adjusted HR, 1.60 [95\% CI, 0.69-3.74]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In children born to mothers receiving public drug coverage in Ontario, Canada, in utero serotonergic antidepressant exposure compared with no exposure was not associated with autism spectrum disorder in the child. Although a causal relationship cannot be ruled out, the previously observed association may be explained by other factors.},

We present a strong, unified statement on roles of expert judgment in statistics with processes for obtaining input, whether from a Bayesian or frequentist perspective. Topics include the role of subjectivity in the cycle of scientific inference and decisions, followed by a clinical trial and a greenhouse gas emissions case study that illustrate the role of judgments and the importance of basing them on objective information and a comprehensive uncertainty assessment. We close with a call for increased proactivity and involvement of statisticians in study conceptualization, design, conduct, analysis, and communication.},

These treatments included antivirals, immune modulators, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 neutralizing antibodies, and organ-supportive treatments at both the preclinical and clinical stages of development. The ACTIV Therapeutics-Clinical Working Group Agent Prioritization subgroup established a uniform data collection process required to perform an assessment of any agent type using review criteria that were identified and differentially weighted for each agent class. The ACTIV Therapeutics-Clinical Working Group evaluated over 750 therapeutic agents with potential application for coronavirus disease 2019 and prioritized promising candidates for testing within the master protocols conducted by ACTIV. In addition, promising agents among preclinical candidates were selected by ACTIV to be matched with laboratories that could assist in executing rigorous preclinical studies. Between April 14, 2020, and May 31, 2021, the Agent Prioritization subgroup advanced 20 agents into the Accelerating Coronavirus Disease 2019 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines master protocols and matched 25 agents with laboratories to assist with preclinical testing.},

We tested the hypothesis that CBF in acute ICH patients is unaffected by BP reduction. Methods\textemdash Patients with spontaneous ICH {$<$}24 hours after onset and systolic BP {$>$} 150 mm\,Hg were randomly assigned to an intravenous antihypertensive treatment protocol targeting a systolic BP of {$<$}150 mm\,Hg (n=39) or {$<$}180 mm\,Hg (n=36). Patients underwent computed tomography perfusion imaging 2 hours postrandomization. The primary end point was perihematoma relative (relative CBF). Results\textemdash Treatment groups were balanced with respect to baseline systolic BP: 182{$\pm$}20 mm\,Hg ({$<$}150 mm\,Hg target group) versus 184{$\pm$}25 mm\,Hg ({$<$}180 mmHg target group; P=0.60), and for hematoma volume: 25.6{$\pm$}30.8 versus 26.9{$\pm$}25.2 mL \hspace{0.25em} (P=0.66). Mean systolic BP 2 hours after randomization was significantly lower in the {$<$}150 mm\,Hg target group (140{$\pm$}19 vs 162{$\pm$}12 mm\,Hg; P{$<$}0.001). Perihematoma CBF (38.7{$\pm$}11.9 mL/100 g per minute) was lower than in contralateral homologous regions (44.1{$\pm$}11.1 mL/100 g per minute; P{$<$}0.001) in all patients. The primary end point of perihematoma relative CBF in the {$<$}150 mm\,Hg target group (0.86{$\pm$}0.12) was not significantly lower than that in the {$<$}180 mm\,Hg group (0.89{$\pm$}0.09; P=0.19; absolute difference, 0.03; 95\% confidence interval -0.018 to 0.078). There was no relationship between the magnitude of BP change and perihematoma relative CBF in the {$<$}150 mm\,Hg (R=0.00005; 95\% confidence interval, -0.001 to 0.001) or {$<$}180 mm\,Hg target groups (R=0.000; 95\% confidence interval, -0.001 to 0.001). Conclusions\textemdash Rapid BP lowering after a moderate volume of ICH does not reduce perihematoma CBF.

This article seeks to address both applied practitioners and researchers interested in a more formal explanation of some of the results. For practitioners, the framework, illustrative examples and code should equip them with a practical approach to address the issues raised by missing data (particularly using multiple imputation), alongside an overview of how the various approaches in the literature relate. In particular, we describe how multiple imputation can be readily used for sensitivity analyses, which are still infrequently performed. For those interested in more formal derivations, we give outline arguments for key results, use simple examples to show how methods relate, and references for full details. The ideas are illustrated with a cohort study, a multi-centre case control study and a randomised clinical trial.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antiplatelet treatment remains the first choice for primary and secondary prevention of vascular diseases; even so, expected benefits may be offset by risk of bleeding, particularly cerebral hemorrhage. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of antiplatelet treatment on clinical outcome at hospital discharge. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with first-ever stroke due to a primary intraparenchymal hemorrhage were prospectively identified over a 4-year period (2000-2003). Data on hemorrhage location, vascular risk factors, and antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatment were collected. At discharge, outcome was measured using the modified Rankin Scale (disabling stroke {$>$} or =3). Patients treated with anticoagulant therapy were excluded from the study. RESULTS: Of 457 consecutive patients with cerebral hemorrhage, 94 (20.5\%) had been taking antiplatelet agents. The treated patients (mean age for antiplatelet group 78.9 +/- 9.0 years) were older than the nontreated patients (73.8 +/- 9.4, p = 0.02). In-hospital mortality was 23.4 and 23.1\% (p = n.s.) for patients who had been taking antiplatelet agents or no treatment. Poor outcome at discharge was found in 52.1 and 59.7\% (p = n.s.), respectively. Univariate analysis showed that age and coma at admission were predictors of disability at discharge, but antiplatelet treatment was not. Additionally, age and coma were shown to be determinants of disability at discharge after multivariate analysis: OR 1.03 per year (95\% CI: 1.018-1.049), p {$<$} 0.001 and OR 1.68 (95\% CI: 1.138-2.503), p = 0.009, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Hemorrhagic stroke continues to be responsible for a high percentage of disability and death. Furthermore, it was seen here that functional outcome was independent of previous antiplatelet treatment.},

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has shone a light on this need. The literature on nutrition and COVID-19 mainly focuses on the importance of nutrition to preserve life and prevent clinical deterioration during the acute phase of illness. However, there is a lack of information guiding practice across the whole patient journey (e.g., hospital to home) with a focus on targeting recovery (e.g., long COVID). This review paper is of relevance to doctors and other healthcare professionals in acute care and primary care worldwide, since it addresses early, multi-modal individualised nutrition interventions across the continuum of care to improve COVID-19 patient outcomes. It is of relevance to nutrition experts and non-nutrition experts and can be used to promote inter-professional and inter-organisational knowledge transfer on the topic. The primary goal is to prevent complications and support recovery to enable COVID-19 patients to achieve the best possible nutritional, physical, functional and mental health status and to apply the learning to date from the COVID-19 pandemic to other patient groups experiencing acute severe illness.},

This has generated renewed interest regarding whether corticosteroids should be used in non-COVID ARDS as well. The objective of this study was to summarize all RCTs examining the use of corticosteroids in ARDS. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} The protocol of this study was pre-registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020200659). We searched online databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CDC library of COVID research, CINAHL, and COCHRANE. We included RCTs that compared the effect of corticosteroids to placebo or usual care in adult patients with ARDS, including patients with COVID-19. Three reviewers abstracted data independently and in duplicate using a pre-specified standardized form. We assessed individual study risk of bias using the revised Cochrane ROB-2 tool and rated certainty in outcomes using GRADE methodology. We pooled data using a random effects model. The main outcome for this review was 28-day-mortality. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We included 18 RCTs enrolling 2826 patients. The use of corticosteroids probably reduced mortality in patients with ARDS of any etiology (2740 patients in 16 trials, RR 0.82, 95\% CI 0.72\textendash 0.95, ARR 8.0\%, 95\% CI 2.2\textendash 12.5\%, moderate certainty). Patients who received a longer course of corticosteroids (over 7 days) had higher rates of survival compared to a shorter course. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} The use of corticosteroids probably reduces mortality in patients with ARDS. This effect was consistent between patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS, corticosteroid types, and dosage.},

We explored the prevalence and outcomes of acute stroke in an international cohort of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who required ICU admission. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected database. SETTING: A registry of coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted to ICUs at over 370 international sites was reviewed for patients diagnosed with acute stroke during their stay. PATIENTS: Patients older than 18 years old with acute coronavirus disease 2019 infection in ICU. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 2,699 patients identified (median age 59 yr; male 65\%), 59 (2.2\%) experienced acute stroke: 0.7\% ischemic, 1.0\% hemorrhagic, and 0.5\% unspecified type. Systemic anticoagulant use was not associated with any stroke type. The frequency of diabetes, hypertension, and smoking was higher in patients with ischemic stroke than in stroke-free and hemorrhagic stroke patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was more common among patients with hemorrhagic (56\%) and ischemic stroke (16\%) than in those without stroke (10\%). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients had higher cumulative 90-day probabilities of hemorrhagic (relative risk = 10.5) and ischemic stroke (relative risk = 1.7) versus nonextracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients. Hemorrhagic stroke increased the hazard of death (hazard ratio = 2.74), but ischemic stroke did not\textemdash similar to the effects of these stroke types seen in noncoronavirus disease 2019 ICU patients. CONCLUSIONS: In an international registry of ICU patients with coronavirus disease 2019, stroke was infrequent. Hemorrhagic stroke, but not ischemic stroke, was associated with increased mortality. Further, both hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke were associated with traditional vascular risk factors. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use was strongly associated with both stroke and death.},

  abstract = {Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a disorder characterized by excretion of large amounts of hypotonic urine. Central DI results from a deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, whereas nephrogenic DI results from resistance to AVP in the kidneys. Central and nephrogenic DI are usually acquired, but genetic causes must be evaluated, especially if symptoms occur in early childhood. Central or nephrogenic DI must be differentiated from primary polydipsia, which involves excessive intake of large amounts of water despite normal AVP secretion and action. Primary polydipsia is most common in psychiatric patients and health enthusiasts but the polydipsia in a small subgroup of patients seems to be due to an abnormally low thirst threshold, a condition termed dipsogenic DI. Distinguishing between the different types of DI can be challenging and is done either by a water deprivation test or by hypertonic saline stimulation together with copeptin (or AVP) measurement. Furthermore, a detailed medical history{$\mkern1mu$}, physical examination and imaging studies are needed to ensure an accurate DI diagnosis. Treatment of DI or primary polydipsia depends on the underlying aetiology and differs in central DI, nephrogenic DI and primary polydipsia.},

  abstract = {Surgery and anaesthesia subject the brain to considerable stress in the peri-operative period. This may be caused by potentially neurotoxic anaesthetic drugs, impaired cerebral perfusion and reperfusion injury related to surgery or thromboembolic events. Patient monitoring using electroencephalogram and cerebral oximetry can assist in optimising depth of anaesthesia and assessment of cerebral metabolic activity. However, research findings have been contradictory as to whether these monitors can help ameliorate peri-operative neurocognitive complications. In this narrative review, we will discuss recent evidence in the use of electroencephalography and cerebral oximetry and the underlying scientific principles. It is important to appreciate the raw electroencephalographic changes under anaesthesia and those associated with ageing, in order to interpret depth of anaesthesia indices correctly. Cerebral oximetry is useful not only for the detection of cerebral desaturation but also to identify those patients who are particularly vulnerable to injury, for better risk stratification. An algorithm-based approach may be most effective in managing the episodes of cerebral desaturation.},

  abstract = {Many students of statistics and econometrics express frustration with the way a problem known as ``bad control'' is treated in the traditional literature. The issue arises when the addition of a variable to a regression equation produces an unintended discrepancy between the regression coefficient and the effect that the coefficient is expected to represent. Avoiding such discrepancies presents a challenge to all analysts in the data intensive sciences. This note describes graphical tools for understanding, visualizing, and resolving the problem through a series of illustrative examples. We have found that the cases presented here can serve as a powerful instructional device to supplement more extended and formal discussions of the problem. By making this ``crash course'' accessible to instructors and practitioners, we hope to avail these tools to a broader community of scientists concerned with the causal interpretation of regression models.},

Methods:\hspace{0.6em} Secondary analysis of CENTER-TBI, a multicentre, prospective, observational, cohort study. The primary aim was to describe current practice in \-PaCO2 management during the first week of intensive care unit (ICU) after TBI, focusing on the lowest \-PaCO2 values. We also assessed \-PaCO2 management in patients with and without ICP monitoring \-(ICPm), and with and without intracranial hypertension. We evaluated the effect of profound hyperventilation (defined as \-PaCO2\,{$<$}\,30 mmHg) on long-term outcome. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We included 1100 patients, with a total of 11,791 measurements of \-PaCO2 (5931 lowest and 5860 highest daily values). The mean ({$\pm$}\, SD) \-PaCO2 was 38.9 ({$\pm$}\,5.2) mmHg, and the mean minimum \-PaCO2 was 35.2 ({$\pm$}\,5.3) mmHg. Mean daily minimum P\- aCO2 values were significantly lower in the \-ICPm group (34.5 vs 36.7 mmHg, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Daily \-PaCO2 nadir was lower in patients with intracranial hypertension (33.8 vs 35.7 mmHg, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Considerable heterogeneity was observed between centers. Management in a centre using profound hyperventilation (HV) more frequently was not associated with increased 6 months mortality (OR\,=\,1.06, 95\% CI\,=\,0.77\textendash 1.45, p value\,=\,0.7166), or unfavourable neurological outcome (OR 1.12, 95\% CI\,=\,0.90\textendash 1.38, p value = 0.3138). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Ventilation is manipulated differently among centers and in response to intracranial dynamics. P\- aCO2 tends to be lower in patients with ICP monitoring, especially if ICP is increased. Being in a centre which more frequently uses profound hyperventilation does not affect patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {Brain function critically depends on a close matching between metabolic demands, appropriate delivery of oxygen and nutrients, and removal of cellular waste. This matching requires continuous regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF), which can be categorized into four broad topics: 1) autoregulation, which describes the response of the cerebrovasculature to changes in perfusion pressure; 2) vascular reactivity to vasoactive stimuli [including carbon dioxide (CO )]; 3) neurovascular coupling (NVC), i.e., the CBF response to local changes in neural activity (often stan2dardized cognitive stimuli in humans); and 4) endothelium-dependent responses. This review focuses primarily on autoregulation and its clinical implications. To place autoregulation in a more precise context, and to better understand integrated approaches in the cerebral circulation, we also briefly address reactivity to CO and NVC. In addition to our focus on effects of perfusion pressure (or blood pressure), we describe the i2mpact of select stimuli on regulation of CBF (i.e., arterial blood gases, cerebral metabolism, neural mechanisms, and specific vascular cells), the interrelationships between these stimuli, and implications for regulation of CBF at the level of large arteries and the microcirculation. We review clinical implications of autoregulation in aging, hypertension, stroke, mild cognitive impairment, anesthesia, and dementias. Finally, we discuss autoregulation in the context of common daily physiological challenges, including changes in posture (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, syncope) and physical activity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Andexanet alfa (andexanet) is a recombinant modified human factor Xa decoy protein that has been shown to reverse the inhibition of factor Xa in healthy volunteers. METHODS In this multicenter, prospective, open-label, single-group study, we evaluated 67 patients who had acute major bleeding within 18 hours after the administration of a factor Xa inhibitor. The patients all received a bolus of andexanet followed by a 2-hour infusion of the drug. Patients were evaluated for changes in measures of anti\textendash factor Xa activity and were assessed for clinical hemostatic efficacy during a 12-hour period. All the patients were subsequently followed for 30 days. The efficacy population of 47 patients had a baseline value for anti\textendash factor Xa activity of at least 75 ng per milliliter (or {$\geq$}0.5 IU per milliliter for those receiving enoxaparin) and had confirmed bleeding severity at adjudication. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 77 years; most of the patients had substantial cardiovascular disease. Bleeding was predominantly gastrointestinal or intracranial. The mean ({$\pm$}SD) time from emergency department presentation to the administration of the andexanet bolus was 4.8{$\pm$}1.8 hours. After the bolus administration, the median anti\textendash factor Xa activity decreased by 89\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 58 to 94) from baseline among patients receiving rivaroxaban and by 93\% (95\% CI, 87 to 94) among patients receiving apixaban. These levels remained similar during the 2-hour infusion. Four hours after the end of the infusion, there was a relative decrease from baseline of 39\% in the measure of anti\textendash factor Xa activity among patients receiving rivaroxaban and of 30\% among those receiving apixaban. Twelve hours after the andexanet infusion, clinical hemostasis was adjudicated as excellent or good in 37 of 47 patients in the efficacy analysis (79\%; 95\% CI, 64 to 89). Thrombotic events occurred in 12 of 67 patients (18\%) during the 30-day follow-up.

Dabigatran is a new oral direct thrombin inhibitor. Methods In this noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned 18,113 patients who had atrial fibrillation and a risk of stroke to receive, in a blinded fashion, fixed doses of dabigatran \textemdash{} 110 mg or 150 mg twice daily \textemdash{} or, in an unblinded fashion, adjusted-dose warfarin. The median duration of the follow-up period was 2.0 years. The primary outcome was stroke or systemic embolism. Results Rates of the primary outcome were 1.69\% per year in the warfarin group, as compared with 1.53\% per year in the group that received 110 mg of dabigatran (relative risk with dabigatran, 0.91; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 1.11; P{$<$}0.001 for noninferiority) and 1.11\% per year in the group that received 150 mg of dabigatran (relative risk, 0.66; 95\% CI, 0.53 to 0.82; P{$<$}0.001 for superiority). The rate of major bleeding was 3.36\% per year in the warfarin group, as compared with 2.71\% per year in the group receiving 110 mg of dabigatran (P\,=\,0.003) and 3.11\% per year in the group receiving 150 mg of dabigatran (P\,=\,0.31). The rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.38\% per year in the warfarin group, as compared with 0.12\% per year with 110 mg of dabigatran (P{$<$}0.001) and 0.10\% per year with 150 mg of dabigatran (P{$<$}0.001). The mortality rate was 4.13\% per year in the warfarin group, as compared with 3.75\% per year with 110 mg of dabigatran (P\,=\,0.13) and 3.64\% per year with 150 mg of dabigatran (P\,=\,0.051). Conclusions In patients with atrial fibrillation, dabigatran given at a dose of 110 mg was associated with rates of stroke and systemic embolism that were similar to those associated with warfarin, as well as lower rates of major hemorrhage. Dabigatran administered at a dose of 150 mg, as compared with warfarin, was associated with lower rates of stroke and systemic embolism but similar rates of major hemorrhage.

METHODS We evaluated 352 patients who had acute major bleeding within 18 hours after administration of a factor Xa inhibitor. The patients received a bolus of andexanet, followed by a 2-hour infusion. The coprimary outcomes were the percent change in anti\textendash factor Xa activity after andexanet treatment and the percentage of patients with excellent or good hemostatic efficacy at 12 hours after the end of the infusion, with hemostatic efficacy adjudicated on the basis of prespecified criteria. Efficacy was assessed in the subgroup of patients with confirmed major bleeding and baseline anti\textendash factor Xa activity of at least 75 ng per milliliter (or {$\geq$}0.25 IU per milliliter for those receiving enoxaparin). RESULTS Patients had a mean age of 77 years, and most had substantial cardiovascular disease. Bleeding was predominantly intracranial (in 227 patients [64\%]) or gastrointestinal (in 90 patients [26\%]). In patients who had received apixaban, the median anti\textendash factor Xa activity decreased from 149.7 ng per milliliter at baseline to 11.1 ng per milliliter after the andexanet bolus (92\% reduction; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 91 to 93); in patients who had received rivaroxaban, the median value decreased from 211.8 ng per milliliter to 14.2 ng per milliliter (92\% reduction; 95\% CI, 88 to 94). Excellent or good hemostasis occurred in 204 of 249 patients (82\%) who could be evaluated. Within 30 days, death occurred in 49 patients (14\%) and a thrombotic event in 34 (10\%). Reduction in anti\textendash factor Xa activity was not predictive of hemostatic efficacy overall but was modestly predictive in patients with intracranial hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS In patients with acute major bleeding associated with the use of a factor Xa inhibitor, treatment with andexanet markedly reduced anti\textendash factor Xa activity, and 82\% of patients had excellent or good hemostatic efficacy at 12 hours, as adjudicated according to prespecified criteria.

Study Design and Setting: The trial will enroll 720 unique patients in emergency departments and uses a Bayesian adaptive design. Results: The trial design is compared to a trial without adaptive randomization and produces an efficient trial in which a higher proportion of patients are likely to be randomized to the most effective treatment arm while generally using fewer total patients and offers higher power than an analogous trial with fixed randomization when identifying a superior treatment. Conclusion: When one treatment is superior to the other two, the trial design provides better patient care, higher power, and a lower expected sample size. \'O 2013 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Background and Purpose: Thirty-day mortality rates in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) range from 35\% to 50\%, with only 10\textendash 20\% of the survivors regaining functional independence. This high mortality and morbidity argues for the optimization of emergency medical services (EMS), emergency department (ED), and in-patient treatment paradigms. With the development of interventional strategies for ICH, both pharmacologic and surgical, time to treatment will be critical to improving outcomes. Similar to acute ischemic stroke care, proper preparation and role definition will be critical for efficient evaluation and treatment. We studied the existence and structure of ICH management protocols in US hospitals. Methods: A national survey of Emergency Medicine physicians was conducted to gather information regarding the existence of stroke and ICH treatment protocols at their institutions. Results: A clearly established pathway for the management of ischemic stroke exists in most hospitals (78\%). By contrast, only 30\% of hospitals have a clearly defined pathway for ICH. Thus, while most hospitals are able to perform rapid computed tomography (CT) scans to diagnose ICH, the management of these patients post-CT is more fragmented and variable. Few hospitals have comprehensive protocols that include treatment policies for raised intracranial pressure or formal policies for the transfer of patients to centers with neurocritical care/neurosurgical resources. Recommendations: Integration of ICH critical pathways into stroke protocols could potentially improve the high mortality and disability associated with this condition and might facilitate ongoing studies of ICH-specific interventions. With stroke neurologists and neurocritical care specialists showing an increasing interest in ICH management, development of critical pathways may allow for a standardized approach to best treatment practices within institutions and networks as evidence grows for new treatments and management strategies. This may also allow a redefinition of the roles of team members, including ED and critical care physicians, neurologists, and neurosurgeons.}

We measured quantitative lung computed tomography, esophageal pressure swings and total lung stress. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Patients were divided in five subgroups based on their baseline \-PaO2/FiO2 (day 1): non-CARDS (median \-PaO2/FiO2 361 mmHg, IQR [323\textendash 379]), mild (224 mmHg [211\textendash 249]), mild-moderate (173 mmHg [164\textendash 185]), moderate-severe (126 mmHg [114\textendash 138]) and severe (88 mmHg [86\textendash 99], p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Each subgroup had similar median lung weight: 1215 g [1083\textendash 1294], 1153 [888\textendash 1321], 968 [858\textendash 1253], 1060 [869\textendash 1269], and 1127 [937\textendash 1193] (p\,=\,0.37).

Their urgent deployment was defended with modelling and observational data of spurious credibility. There is major debate on whether these measures are effective and there is also uncertainty about the magnitude of the harms that these measures might induce. Given that there is equipoise for how, when and if specific social distancing interventions for COVID-19 should be applied and removed/modified during reopening, we argue that informative randomised-controlled trials are needed. Only a few such randomised trials have already been conducted, but the ones done to-date demonstrate that a randomised trials agenda is feasible. We discuss here issues of study design choice, selection of comparators (intervention and controls), choice of outcomes and additional considerations for the conduct of such trials. We also discuss and refute common counter-arguments against the conduct of such trials.},

A major limitation of current meta-analysis techniques is their inability to pool ordinal data. Our objectives were to determine the extent of this problem in the context of neurological rating scales and to provide a solution. Methods Using an existing database of clinical trials of oral neuroprotective therapies, we identified the 6 most commonly used clinical rating scales and recorded how data from these scales were reported and analysed. We then identified systematic reviews of studies that used these scales (via the Cochrane database) and recorded the meta-analytic techniques used. Finally, we identified a statistical technique for calculating a common language effect size measure for ordinal data. Results We identified 103 studies, with 128 instances of the 6 clinical scales being reported. The majority\textendash{} 80\%\textendash reported means alone for central tendency, with only 13\% reporting medians. In analysis, 40\% of studies used parametric statistics alone, 34\% of studies employed non-parametric analysis, and 26\% did not include or specify analysis. Of the 60 systematic reviews identified that included meta-analysis, 88\% used mean difference and 22\% employed difference in proportions; none included rank-based analysis. We propose the use of a rank-based generalised odds ratio (WMW GenOR) as an assumptionfree effect size measure that is easy to compute and can be readily combined in metaanalysis. Conclusion There is wide scope for improvement in the reporting and analysis of ordinal data in the literature. We hope that adoption of the WMW GenOR will have the dual effect of improving the},

  abstract = {Purpose:\hspace{0.6em} Oral chlorhexidine is used widely for mechanically ventilated patients to prevent pneumonia, but recent studies show an association with excess mortality. We examined whether de-adoption of chlorhexidine and parallel implementation of a standardized oral care bundle reduces intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in mechanically venti-lated patients. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} A stepped wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial with concurrent process evaluation in 6 ICUs in Toronto, Canada. Clusters were randomized to de-adopt chlorhexidine and implement a standardized oral care bun-dle at 2-month intervals. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. Secondary outcomes were time to infection-related ventilator-associated complications (IVACs), oral procedural pain and oral health dysfunction. An exploratory post hoc analysis examined time to extubation in survivors. Results:\hspace{0.6em} A total of 3260 patients were enrolled; 1560 control, 1700 intervention. ICU mortality for the intervention and control periods were 399 (23.5\%) and 330 (21.2\%), respectively (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.13; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.82 to 1.54; P\,=\,0.46). Time to IVACs (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.06; 95\% CI 0.44 to 2.57; P\,=\,0.90), time to extubation (aHR 1.03; 95\% CI 0.85 to 1.23; P\,=\,0.79) (survivors) and oral procedural pain (aOR, 0.62; 95\% CI 0.34 to 1.10; P\,=\,0.10) were similar between control and intervention periods. However, oral health dysfunction scores (-\,0.96; 95\% CI\,-\,1.75 to\,-\,0.17; P\,=\,0.02) improved in the intervention period. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} Among mechanically ventilated ICU patients, no benefit was observed for de-adoption of chlorhexidine and implementation of an oral care bundle on ICU mortality, IVACs, oral procedural pain, or time to extubation. The intervention may improve oral health.},

Although on Oxford `A' REC (an NHS Research Ethics Committee based in the UK) we've been impressed by the thought and work put into this aspect of research ethics, we've continued to have concerns about the suitability and effectiveness of consent processes in supporting decision making, particularly for clinical trials. There's poor understanding of what people want to help them decide; current processes don't provide the best grounding for informed consent and there's inadequate public involvement. We've also found a lack of proportionality with researchers failing to adapt consent procedures in proportion to the burdens and consequences of the study. As a result, people are often not best helped to make an informed choice when asked to join a research study. To address these concerns, we considered how we might improve this aspect of research ethics review. Recognising the central importance of the dialogue between the volunteer and researcher, we've drawn up a model or flowchart of what we deem good consent practice, proposing consent should be built around four simple steps:             Step 1: Introducing the study and the choices: helping the potential participants get an overview of the proposal and introducing the key issues.             Step 2: Explaining all the details of the study using the detailed Participant Information Sheet.             Step 3: After a gap, if necessary, reviewing and checking understanding.             Step 4: Reaching agreement and recording consent.             These steps, we believe, could help all involved and this article lays out ways we might improve participant choice while complying with accepted principles and current regulations.},

Methods: Associations between ICH sites and poor outcomes (death [6] or major disability [3\textendash 5] of modified Rankin Scale) and European Quality of Life Scale (EQ-5D) utility scores at 90 days were assessed in logistic regression models. Results: Of 2,066 patients included in the analyses, associations were identified between ICH sites and poor outcomes: involvement of posterior limb of internal capsule increased risks of death or major disability (odds ratio [OR] 2.10) and disability (OR 1.81); thalamic involvement increased risks of death or major disability (OR 2.24) and death (OR 1.97). Involvement of the posterior limb of the internal capsule, thalamus, and infratentorial sites were each associated with poor EQ-5D utility score (\#0.7 [median]; OR 1.87, 2.14, and 2.81, respectively). Posterior limb of internal capsule involvement was strongly associated with low scores across all health-related quality of life domains. ICH encompassing the thalamus and posterior limb of internal capsule were associated with death or major disability, major disability, and poor EQ-5D utility score (OR 1.72, 2.26, and 1.71, respectively). Conclusion: Poor clinical outcomes are related to ICH affecting the posterior limb of internal capsule, thalamus, and infratentorial sites. The highest association with death or major disability and poor EQ-5D utility score was seen in ICH encompassing the thalamus and posterior limb of internal capsule.},

Hemostatic efficacy and reversal of anti-FXa activity with andexanet were assessed in patients from the ANNEXA-4 study (Andexanet Alfa, a Novel Antidote to the Anticoagulation Effects of FXa Inhibitors) with intracranial hemorrhage (ICrH). METHODS: ANNEXA-4 was a single-arm study evaluating andexanet in patients presenting with major bleeding {$\leq$}18 hours after taking an FXa inhibitor. Patients received a bolus plus 2-hour infusion of andexanet. Brain imaging in patients with ICrH was performed at baseline and at 1 and 12 hours postandexanet infusion. Coprimary efficacy outcomes were change in anti-FXa activity and hemostatic efficacy at 12 hours (excellent/good efficacy defined as {$\leq$}35\% increase in hemorrhage volume/thickness). Safety outcomes included occurrence of thrombotic events and death at 30 days. RESULTS: A total of 227 patients with ICrH were included in the safety population (51.5\% male; mean age 79.3 years) and 171 in the efficacy population (99 spontaneous and 72 traumatic bleeds). In efficacy evaluable patients, excellent/good hemostasis 12 hours postandexanet occurred in 77 out of 98 (78.6\%) and in 58 out of 70 (82.9\%) patients with spontaneous and traumatic bleeding, respectively. In the subanalysis by FXa inhibitor treatment group in the efficacy population, median of percent change in anti-FXa from baseline to nadir showed a decrease of 93.8\% for apixaban-treated patients (n=99) and by 92.6\% for rivaroxaban-treated patients (n=59). Within 30 days, death occurred in 34 out of 227 (15.0\%) patients and thrombotic events occurred in 21 out of 227 (9.3\%) patients (safety population). CONCLUSIONS: Andexanet reduced anti-FXa activity in FXa inhibitor-treated patients with ICrH, with a high rate of hemostatic efficacy. Andexanet may substantially benefit patients with ICrH, the most serious complication of anticoagulation.},

  abstract = {Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage is a devastating disease, accounting for 10 to 15\% of all types of stroke; however, it is associated with disproportionally higher rates of mortality and disability. Despite significant progress in the acute management of these patients, the ideal surgical management is still to be determined. Surgical hematoma drainage has many theoretical benefits, such as the prevention of mass effect and cerebral herniation, reduction in intracranial pressure, and the decrease of excitotoxicity and neurotoxicity of blood products., Several surgical techniques have been considered, such as open craniotomy, decompressive craniectomy, neuroendoscopy, and minimally invasive catheter evacuation followed by thrombolysis. Open craniotomy is the most studied approach in this clinical scenario, the first randomized controlled trial dating from the early 1960s. Since then, a large number of studies have been published, which included two large, well-designed, well-powered, multicenter, multinational, randomized clinical trials. These studies, The International Surgical Trial in Intracerebral Hemorrhage (STICH), and the STICH II have shown no clinical benefit for early surgical evacuation of intraparenchymal hematoma in patients with spontaneous supratentorial hemorrhage when compared with best medical management plus delayed surgery if necessary. However, the results of STICH trials may not be generalizable, because of the high rates of patients' crossover from medical management to the surgical group. Without these high crossover percentages, the rates of unfavorable outcome and death with conservative management would have been higher. Additionally, comatose patients and patients at risk of cerebral herniation were not included. In these cases, surgery may be lifesaving, which prevented those patients of being enrolled in such trials. This article reviews the clinical evidence of surgical hematoma evacuation, and its role to decrease mortality and improve long-term functional outcome after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Myocardial infarction is a frequent cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, the benefits of early coronary angiography and revascularization in resuscitated patients without electrocardiographic evidence of ST-segment elevation are unclear. METHODS In this multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 554 patients with successfully resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of possible coronary origin to undergo either immediate coronary angiography (immediate-angiography group) or initial intensive care assessment with delayed or selective angiography (delayed-angiography group). All the patients had no evidence of ST-segment elevation on postresuscitation electrocardiography. The primary end point was death from any cause at 30 days. Secondary end points included a composite of death from any cause or severe neurologic deficit at 30 days. RESULTS A total of 530 of 554 patients (95.7\%) were included in the primary analysis. At 30 days, 143 of 265 patients (54.0\%) in the immediate-angiography group and 122 of 265 patients (46.0\%) in the delayed-angiography group had died (hazard ratio, 1.28; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.00 to 1.63; P\,=\,0.06). The composite of death or severe neurologic deficit occurred more frequently in the immediate-angiography group (in 164 of 255 patients [64.3\%]) than in the delayed-angiography group (in 138 of 248 patients [55.6\%]), for a relative risk of 1.16 (95\% CI, 1.00 to 1.34). Values for peak troponin release and for the incidence of moderate or severe bleeding, stroke, and renal-replacement therapy were similar in the two groups.

  abstract = {Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability, and is associated with a huge societal and economic burden. Interventions for the immediate treatment of ischaemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion are dependent on recanalisation of the occluded vessel. Trials have provided evidence supporting the efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy in ischaemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion. This has resulted in changes in management and organisation of stroke care worldwide. Major determinants of effectiveness of thrombectomy include: time between stroke onset and reperfusion; location of occlusion and local collateral perfusion; adequacy of reperfusion; patient age; and stroke severity. The role of anaesthetic technique on outcome remains controversial with published research showing conflicting results. As a result, choice of conscious sedation or general anaesthesia for mechanical thrombectomy is often dependent on individual operator choice or institutional preference. More recent randomised controlled trials have suggested that protocol-driven general anaesthesia is no worse than conscious sedation and may even be associated with better outcomes. These and other studies have highlighted the importance of optimal blood pressure management as a major determinant of patient outcome. Anaesthetic management should be tailored to the individual patient and circumstances. Acute ischaemic stroke is a neurological emergency; clinicians should focus on minimising door-to-groin puncture time and the provision of high-quality periprocedural care with a particular emphasis on the maintenance of an adequate blood pressure.},

  abstract = {The use of point-of-care ultrasound has increased considerably over the last two decades. It has become a readily available, non-invasive bed-side modality for the rapid diagnosis and management of patients in various settings. Point-of-care ultrasound for assessing the heart, lung, abdomen, airway and vascular systems is now well established. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound for assessing cerebral blood flow has been in use for many years. In recent years, brain ultrasonography has been shown to be a powerful tool in the rapid bed-side assessment of cerebral haemodynamics and structural pathology. Brain ultrasound has been shown to be useful in both the emergency department and neurocritical care setting for the non-invasive assessment of raised intracranial pressure, cerebral autoregulation and diagnosis of intracranial haematoma and other spaceoccupying lesions. Point-of-care ultrasound is an important alternative technique to routine imaging and invasive monitoring techniques, and results are comparable. Competence is easily attainable without formal radiology training. With technological advancement, applications for the use of brain ultrasound continue to grow. This review discusses the clinical use of point-of-care ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of brain injury.},

  abstract = {Objective To determine whether mortality rate after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is lower in patients admitted to a neurologic or neurosurgical (neuro) intensive care unit (ICU) compared to those admitted to general ICUs. Background The utility of specialty ICUs is debated. From a cost perspective, having fewer larger ICUs is preferred. Alternatively, the impact of specialty ICUs on patient outcome is unknown. Patients with ICH are admitted routinely to both general and neuro ICUs and provide an opportunity to address this question. Setting Forty-two neuro, medical, surgical, and medical-surgical ICUs. Measurements and Main Results The study was an analysis of data prospectively collected by Project Impact over 3 yrs from 42 participating ICUs (including one neuro ICU) across the country. The records of 36,986 patients were merged with records of 3,298 patients from a second neuro ICU that collected the same data over the same period. The impact of clinical (age, race, gender, Glasgow Coma Scale score, reason for admission, insurance), ICU (size, number of ICH patients, full-time intensivist, clinical service, American College for Graduate Medical Education or Critical Care Medicine fellowship), and institutional (size, location, medical school affiliation) characteristics on hospital mortality rate of ICH patients was assessed by using a forward-enter multivariate analysis. Data from 1,038 patients were included. The 13 ICUs that admitted {$>$}20 patients accounted for 83\% of the admissions with a mortality rate that ranged from 25\% to 64\%. Multivariate analysis adjusted for patient demographics, severity of ICH, and ICU and institutional characteristics indicated that not being in a neuro ICU was associated with an increase in hospital mortality rate (odds ratio [OR], 3.4; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.65\textendash 7.6). Other factors associated with higher mortality rate were greater age (OR, 1.03/year; 95\% CI, 1.01\textendash 1.04), lower Glasgow Coma Scale score (OR, 0.6/point; 95\% CI, 0.58\textendash 0.65), fewer ICH patients (OR, 1.01/patient; 95\% CI, 1.00\textendash 1.01), and smaller ICU (OR, 1.1/bed; 95\% CI, 1.02\textendash 1.13). Having a full time intensivist was associated with lower mortality rate (OR, 0.388; 95\% CI, 0.22\textendash 0.67). Conclusions For patients with acute ICH, admission to a neuro vs. general ICU is associated with reduced mortality rate.}

  abstract = {Background and Objectives: In clinical trials, the relative risk or risk ratio (RR) is a mainstay of reporting of the effect magnitude for an intervention. The RR is the ratio of the probability of an outcome in an intervention group to its probability in a control group. Thus, the RR provides a measure of change in the likelihood of an event linked to a given intervention. This measure has been widely used because it is today considered a measure with ``portability'' across varying outcome prevalence, especially when the outcome is rare. It turns out, however, that there is a much more important problem with this ratio, and this paper aims to demonstrate this problem. Methods: We used mathematical derivation to determine if the RR is a measure of effect magnitude alone (i.e., a larger absolute value always indicating a stronger effect) or not. We also used the same derivation to determine its relationship to the prevalence of an outcome. We confirm the derivation results with a follow-up analysis of 140,620 trials scraped from the Cochrane. Results: We demonstrate that the RR varies for reasons other than the magnitude of the effect because it is a ratio of two posterior probabilities, both of which are dependent on baseline prevalence of an outcome. In addition, we demonstrate that the RR shifts toward its null value with increasing outcome prevalence. The shift toward the null happens regardless of the strength of the association between intervention and outcome. The odds ratio (OR), the other commonly used ratio, measures solely the effect magnitude and has no relationship to the prevalence of an outcome in a study nor does it overestimate the RR as is commonly thought. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the need to (1) end the primary use of the RR in clinical trials and meta-analyses as its direct interpretation is not meaningful, (2) replace the RR by the OR, and (3) only use the postintervention risk recalculated from the OR for any expected level of baseline risk in absolute terms for purposes of interpretation such as the number needed to treat. These results will have far-reaching implications such as reducing misleading results from clinical trials and meta-analyses and ushering in a new era in the reporting of such trials or meta-analyses in practice. \'O 2020 The Authors.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In mechanically ventilated patients, deep sedation is often assumed to induce ``respirolysis,'' that is, lyse spontaneous respiratory effort, whereas light sedation is often assumed to preserve spontaneous effort. This study was conducted to determine validity of these common assumptions, evaluating the association of respiratory drive with sedation depth and ventilator-free days in acute respiratory failure. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Patients were enrolled during 2 month-long periods in 2016\textendash 2017 from five ICUs representing medical, surgical, and cardiac specialties at a U.S. academic hospital. PATIENTS: Eligible patients were critically ill adults receiving invasive ventilation initiated no more than 36 hours before enrollment. Patients with neuromuscular disease compromising respiratory function or expiratory flow limitation were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Respiratory drive was measured via P0.1, the change in airway pressure during a 0.1-second airway occlusion at initiation of patient inspiratory effort, every 12 {$\pm$} 3 hours for 3 days. Sedation depth was evaluated via the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. Analyses evaluated the association of P0.1 with Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (primary outcome) and ventilator-free days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-six patients undergoing 197 bedside evaluations across five ICUs were included. P0.1 ranged between 0 and 13.3\,cm H2O (median [interquartile range], 0.1\,cm H2O [0.0\textendash 1.3\,cm H2O]). P0.1 was not significantly correlated with the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (R , Spearman 0.02; 95\% CI, \textendash 0.12 to 0.16; p = 0.80). Considering P0.1 terciles (range less than 0.2, 0.2\textendash 1.0, and greater than 1.0\,cm H2O), patients in the middle tercile had significantly more ventilator-free days than the lowest tercile (incidence rate ratio, 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.65\textendash 0.93; p {$<$} 0.01) or highest tercile (incidence rate ratio, 0.58; 95\% CI, 0.48\textendash 0.70; p {$<$} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Sedation depth is not a reliable marker of respiratory drive during critical illness. Respiratory drive can be low, moderate, or high across the range of routinely targeted sedation depth.},

  abstract = {Chronic subdural haematoma (CSDH) is an encapsulated collection of blood and fluid on the surface of the brain. Historically considered a result of head trauma, recent evidence suggests there are more complex processes involved. Trauma may be absent or very minor and does not explain the progressive, chronic course of the condition. This review focuses on several key processes involved in CSDH development: angiogenesis, fibrinolysis and inflammation. The characteristic membrane surrounding the CSDH has been identified as a source of fluid exudation and haemorrhage. Angiogenic stimuli lead to the creation of fragile blood vessels within membrane walls, whilst fibrinolytic processes prevent clot formation resulting in continued haemorrhage. An abundance of inflammatory cells and markers have been identified within the membranes and subdural fluid and are likely to contribute to propagating an inflammatory response which stimulates ongoing membrane growth and fluid accumulation. Currently, the mainstay of treatment for CSDH is surgical drainage, which has associated risks of recurrence requiring repeat surgery. Understanding of the underlying pathophysiological processes has been applied to developing potential drug treatments. Ongoing research is needed to identify if these therapies are successful in controlling the inflammatory and angiogenic disease processes leading to control and resolution of CSDH.},

Advanced neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques have revealed new insights into the biological mechanisms underlying recovery of consciousness and have enabled the identification of preserved brain networks in patients who seem unresponsive, thus raising hope for more accurate diagnosis and prognosis. Emerging evidence suggests that covert consciousness, or cognitive motor dissociation (CMD), is present in up to 15\textendash 20\% of patients with DoC and that detection of CMD in the intensive care unit can predict functional recovery at 1\,year post injury. Although fundamental questions remain about which patients with DoC have the potential for recovery, novel pharmacological and electrophysiological therapies have shown the potential to reactivate injured neural networks and promote re-emergence of consciousness. In this Review, we focus on mechanisms of recovery from DoC in the acute and subacute-to-chronic stages, and we discuss recent progress in detecting and predicting recovery of consciousness. We also describe the developments in pharmacological and electrophysiological therapies that are creating new opportunities to improve the lives of patients with DoC.},

  abstract = {Background/Objective:\hspace{0.6em} For patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC) and their families, the search for new therapies has been a source of hope and frustration. Almost all clinical trials in patients with DoC have been limited by small sample sizes, lack of placebo groups, and use of heterogeneous outcome measures. As a result, few therapies have strong evidence to support their use; amantadine is the only therapy recommended by current clinical guidelines, specifically for patients with DoC caused by severe traumatic brain injury. To foster and advance development of consciousness-promoting therapies for patients with DoC, the Curing Coma Campaign convened a Coma Science Work Group to perform a gap analysis. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We consider five classes of therapies: (1) pharmacologic; (2) electromagnetic; (3) mechanical; (4) sensory; and (5) regenerative. For each class of therapy, we summarize the state of the science, identify gaps in knowledge, and suggest future directions for therapy development. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Knowledge gaps in all five therapeutic classes can be attributed to the lack of: (1) a unifying conceptual framework for evaluating therapeutic mechanisms of action; (2) large-scale randomized controlled trials; and (3) pharmacodynamic biomarkers that measure subclinical therapeutic effects in early-phase trials. To address these gaps, we propose a precision medicine approach in which clinical trials selectively enroll patients based upon their physiological receptivity to targeted therapies, and therapeutic effects are measured by complementary behavioral, neuroimaging, and electrophysiologic endpoints. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} This personalized approach can be realized through rigorous clinical trial design and international collaboration, both of which will be essential for advancing the development of new therapies and ultimately improving the lives of patients with DoC.},

We found that stratification performed poorly with few outcome events, and inverse probability weighting gave imprecise estimates of treatment effect and undue influence to a small number of observations when substantial confounding was present. Covariate adjustment and matching performed well in all of our examples, although matching tended to give less precise estimates in some cases. PS methods are not necessarily superior to conventional covariate adjustment, and care should be taken to select the most suitable method.},

This review discusses current diagnostic, therapeutic, and process models that can expedite stroke treatment to achieve best outcomes. Use of stent retrievers after selection via advanced imaging is safe and effective, and is an important option for AIS patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO). Significant time delays occur before and during patient transfers, and upon comprehensive stroke center (CSC) arrival, and have deleterious effects on functional outcome. Removing obstacles, enhancing inter-facility communication, and creating acute stroke management processes and protocols are paramount strategies to enhance network efficiency. Inter-departmental CSC collaboration can significantly reduce door-to-treatment times. Streamlined stroke systems of care may result in higher treatment rates and better functional outcomes for AIS patients, simultaneously conserving healthcare dollars. Stroke systems of care should be structured regionally to minimize time to treatment. A proactive approach must be employed; a management plan incorporating stroke team prenotification and parallel processes between departments can save valuable time, maximize brain salvage, and reduce disability from stroke.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to determine if biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation can help define coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\textendash associated ischemic stroke as a novel acute ischemic stroke (AIS) subtype. METHODS: We performed a machine learning cluster analysis of common biomarkers in patients admitted with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 to determine if any were associated with AIS. Findings were validated using aggregate data from 3 large healthcare systems. RESULTS: Clustering grouped 2908 unique patient encounters into 4 unique biomarker phenotypes based on levels of c-reactive protein, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, white blood cell count, and partial thromboplastin time. The most severe cluster phenotype had the highest prevalence of AIS (3.6\%, P{$<$}0.001), in-hospital AIS (53\%, P{$<$}0.002), severe AIS (31\%, P=0.004), and cryptogenic AIS (73\%, P{$<$}0.001). D-dimer was the only biomarker independently associated with prevalent AIS with quartile 4 having an 8-fold higher risk of AIS compared to quartile 1 (P=0.005), a finding that was further corroborated in a separate cohort of 157 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and AIS. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19\textendash associated ischemic stroke may be related to COVID-19 illness severity and associated coagulopathy as defined by increasing D-dimer burden.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Sickle cell disease is characterized by hemolytic anemia, pain, and progressive organ damage. A high level of erythrocyte fetal hemoglobin (HbF) comprising {$\alpha$}- and {$\gamma$}-globins may ameliorate these manifestations by mitigating sickle hemoglobin polymerization and erythrocyte sickling. BCL11A is a repressor of {$\gamma$}-globin expression and HbF production in adult erythrocytes. Its down-regulation is a promising therapeutic strategy for induction of HbF. METHODS We enrolled patients with sickle cell disease in a single-center, open-label pilot study. The investigational therapy involved infusion of autologous CD34+ cells transduced with the BCH-BB694 lentiviral vector, which encodes a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting BCL11A mRNA embedded in a microRNA (shmiR), allowing erythroid lineage\textendash specific knockdown. Patients were assessed for primary end points of engraftment and safety and for hematologic and clinical responses to treatment. RESULTS As of October 2020, six patients had been followed for at least 6 months after receiving BCH-BB694 gene therapy; median follow-up was 18 months (range, 7 to 29). All patients had engraftment, and adverse events were consistent with effects of the preparative chemotherapy. All the patients who could be fully evaluated achieved robust and stable HbF induction (percentage HbF/(F+S) at most recent follow-up, 20.4 to 41.3\%), with HbF broadly distributed in red cells (F-cells 58.9 to 93.6\% of untransfused red cells) and HbF per F-cell of 9.0 to 18.6 pg per cell. Clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease were reduced or absent during the follow-up period.

  abstract = {Peri-operative neurocognitive disorders are the most common complication experienced by older individuals undergoing anaesthesia and surgery. Peri-operative neurocognitive disorders, particularly postoperative delirium, result in long-term poor outcomes including: death; dementia; loss of independence; and poor cognitive and functional outcomes. Recent changes to the nomenclature of these disorders aims to align perioperative neurocognitive disorders with cognitive disorders in the community, with consistent definitions and clinical diagnosis. Possible mechanisms include: undiagnosed neurodegenerative disease; inflammation and resulting neuroinflammation; neuronal damage; and comorbid systemic disease. Pre-operative frailty represents a significant risk for poor postoperative outcomes; it is associated with an increase in the incidence of cognitive decline at 3 and 12 months postoperatively. In addition to cognitive decline, frailty is associated with poor functional outcomes following elective non-cardiac surgery. It was recently shown that 29\% of frail patients died or experienced institutionalisation or new disability within 90 days of major elective surgery. Identification of vulnerable patients before undergoing surgery and anaesthesia is the key to preventing peri-operative neurocognitive disorders. Current approaches include: pre-operative delirium and cognitive screening; blood biomarker analysis; intra-operative management that may reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium such as lighter anaesthesia using processed electroencephalography devices; and introduction of guidelines which may reduce or prevent delirium and postoperative neurocognitive disorders. This review will address these issues and advocate for an approach to care for older peri-operative patients which starts in the community and continues throughout the pre-operative, intra-operative, postoperative and post-discharge phases of care management, involving multidisciplinary medical teams, as well as family and caregivers wherever possible.},

  abstract = {Animal cognition research aims to understand animal minds by using a diverse range of methods across an equally diverse range of species. Throughout its history, the field has sought to mitigate various biases that occur when studying animal minds, from experimenter effects to anthropomorphism. Recently, there has also been a focus on how common scientific practices might affect the reliability and validity of published research. Usually, these issues are discussed in the literature by a small group of scholars with a specific interest in the topics. This study aimed to survey a wider range of animal cognition researchers to ask about their attitudes towards classic and contemporary issues facing the field. Two-hundred and ten active animal cognition researchers completed our survey, and provided answers on questions relating to bias, replicability, statistics, publication, and belief in animal cognition. Collectively, researchers were wary of bias in the research field as a whole, but less so in their own work. Despite sometimes (39.7\% of responses) or often (38.8\% of responses) hoping for one result over another, researchers reported that they could often (45.8\% of responses) or always (38.4\% of responses) detach from any biases to perform objectively fair tests of animal cognition. Over 70\% of researchers endorsed Morgan's canon as a useful principle but many caveated this in their free-text responses, and researchers selfreported that a median of 80\% of their studies had been published. Their free-text responses suggested a stronger publication bias against negative and inconclusive results, and results that questioned ``preferred'' theories. Researchers rarely reported having performed questionable research practices themselves \textemdash{} however they thought that other researchers sometimes (52.7\% of responses) or often (27.9\% of responses) perform them. Researchers near unanimously agreed that replication studies are important but too infrequently performed in animal cognition research, and 44.7\% of researchers agreed that their own area (44.7\% of responses), or other areas (73.0\% of responses) of research could experience a `replication crisis' if replication studies were performed. Consistently, participants' free-text responses provided a nuanced picture of the challenges animal cognition research faces, and highlighted many possible improvements. Overall, these data provide a picture of active researchers' beliefs about the animal cognition research processes that can be used to inform debates on where and how the field can improve.},

We hypothesized select patients can be safely cared for in SU versus ICU at lower costs. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with predefined minor ICH ({$\leq$}20 cm3, supratentorial, no coagulopathy) receiving care in either an ICU or an SU. Multiple linear regression and inverse probability weighting were used to adjust for differences in patient characteristics and nonrandom ICU versus SU assignment. The primary outcome was poor functional status at discharge (modified Rankin score [mRS] {$\geq$}3). Secondary outcomes included complications, discharge disposition, hospital length of stay, and direct inpatient costs. The study population included 104 patients (41 admitted to the ICU and 63 admitted to the SU). After controlling for differences in baseline characteristics, there were no differences in poor functional outcome at discharge (93\% vs 85\%, P = .26) or in mean mRS (2.9 vs 3.0, P = .73). Similarly, there were no differences in the rates of complications (6\% vs 10\%, P = .44), discharged dead or to a skilled nursing facility (8\% vs 13\%, P = .59), or direct patient costs (US\$7100 vs US\$6200, P = .33). Median length of stay was significantly longer in the ICU group (5 vs 4 days, P = .01). This study revealed a shorter length of stay but no large differences in functional outcome, safety, or cost among patients with minor ICH admitted to a dedicated SU compared to an ICU.},

  abstract = {Background: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are popular tools for identifying appropriate adjustment strategies for epidemiological analysis. However, a lack of direction on how to build them is problematic. As a solution, we propose using a combination of evidence synthesis strategies and causal inference principles to integrate the DAG-building exercise within the review stages of research projects. We demonstrate this idea by introducing a novel protocol: `Evidence Synthesis for Constructing Directed Acyclic Graphs' (ESC-DAGs)'. Methods: ESC-DAGs operates on empirical studies identified by a literature search, ideally a novel systematic review or review of systematic reviews. It involves three key stages: (i) the conclusions of each study are `mapped' into a DAG; (ii) the causal structures in these DAGs are systematically assessed using several causal inference principles and are corrected accordingly; (iii) the resulting DAGs are then synthesised into one or more `integrated DAGs'. This demonstration article didactically applies ESC-DAGs to the literature on parental influences on offspring alcohol use during adolescence. Conclusions: ESC-DAGs is a practical, systematic and transparent approach for developing DAGs from background knowledge. These DAGs can then direct primary data analysis and DAG-based sensitivity analysis. ESC-DAGs has a modular design to allow researchers who are experienced DAG users to both use and improve upon the approach. It is also accessible to researchers with limited experience of DAGs or evidence synthesis.},

Although many of these patients will require ICU admission, little is known regarding their outcomes and the costs incurred. We evaluated this population in order to identify outcomes and cost patterns. Design: Retrospective cohort analysis of a health administrative database. Setting: Two ICUs within a single hospital system. Patients: Eight-thousand four-hundred forty-seven patients admitted to ICU from 2011 to 2014, of whom 332 had a diagnosis of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage. Control patients were defined as randomly selected age, sex, and comorbidity index\textendash matched nonintracranial hemorrhage ICU patients (1:4 matching ratio). Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Mean age of ICU intracranial hemorrhage patients was 60.1 years, and 120 (36.1\&percnt;) died prior to discharge. Intracranial hemorrhage was associated with a mean total cost of \&dollar;75,869, compared with \&dollar;52,471 in control patients (p {$<$} 0.01). Mean cost per survivor of intracranial hemorrhage patients was \&dollar;118,813. Subarachnoid hemorrhage was associated with significantly higher mean total costs than intracerebral hemorrhage (\&dollar;92,794 vs \&dollar;53,491; p {$<$} 0.01) and higher mean cost per day (\&dollar;4,377 vs \&dollar;3,604; p {$<$} 0.01). Patients with intracranial hemorrhage who survived to hospital discharge were significantly costlier than decedents (\&dollar;100,979 vs \&dollar;30,872; p {$<$} 0.01). Intracranial hemorrhage associated with oral anticoagulant use had a mean total cost of \&dollar;152,373, compared with \&dollar;66,548 in nonoral anticoagulant intracranial hemorrhage (p {$<$} 0.01). Conclusions: Patients admitted to ICU with intracranial hemorrhage have high costs and high mortality, leading to elevated cost per survivor. Subarachnoid hemorrhage patients incur greater costs than intracerebral hemorrhage patients, and oral anticoagulant\textendash associated intracerebral hemorrhage is particularly costly.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Whether the use of balanced multielectrolyte solution (BMES) in preference to 0.9\% sodium chloride solution (saline) in critically ill patients reduces the risk of acute kidney injury or death is uncertain. METHODS In a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned critically ill patients to receive BMES (Plasma-Lyte 148) or saline as fluid therapy in the intensive care unit (ICU) for 90 days. The primary outcome was death from any cause within 90 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes were receipt of new renal-replacement therapy and the maximum increase in the creatinine level during ICU stay. The authors' affiliations are listed in the Appendix.

This article was published on January 18, 2022, at NEJM.org. RESULTS A total of 5037 patients were recruited from 53 ICUs in Australia and New Zealand \textemdash{} 2515 patients were assigned to the BMES group and 2522 to the saline group. Death within 90 days after randomization occurred in 530 of 2433 patients (21.8\%) in the BMES group and in 530 of 2413 patients (22.0\%) in the saline group, for a difference of -0.15 percentage points (95\% confidence interval [CI], -3.60 to 3.30; P\,=\,0.90). New renal-replacement therapy was initiated in 306 of 2403 patients (12.7\%) in the BMES group and in 310 of 2394 patients (12.9\%) in the saline group, for a difference of -0.20 percentage points (95\% CI, -2.96 to 2.56). The mean ({$\pm$}SD) maximum increase in serum creatinine level was 36.6{$\pm$}94.0 {$\mu$}mol per liter (0.41{$\pm$}1.06 mg per deciliter) in the BMES group and 36.1{$\pm$}90.2 {$\mu$}mol per liter (0.41{$\pm$}1.02 mg per deciliter) in the saline group, for a difference of 0.5 {$\mu$}mol per liter (95\% CI, -4.7 to 5.3) (0.01 mg per deciliter [95\% CI, -0.05 to 0.06]). The number of adverse and serious adverse events did not differ meaningfully between the groups. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2114464 Copyright \textcopyright{} 2022 Massachusetts Medical Society. CONCLUSIONS We found no evidence that the risk of death or acute kidney injury among critically ill adults in the ICU was lower with the use of BMES than with saline.

  abstract = {Our aim was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of transferring patients with intracerebral hemorrhage from centers without specialized neurological intensive care units (neuro-ICUs) to centers with neuro-ICUs. Decision analytic models were developed for the lifetime horizons. Model inputs were derived from the best available data, informed by a variety of previous cost-effectiveness models of stroke. The effect of neuro-ICU care on functional outcomes was modeled in 3 scenarios. A favorable outcomes scenario was modeled based on the best observational data and compared with moderately favorable and least-favorable outcomes scenarios. Health benefits were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs were estimated from a societal perspective. Costs were combined with QALYs gained to generate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. One-way sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to test robustness of the model assumptions. Transferring patients to centers with neuro-ICUs yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the lifetime horizon of \$47 431 per QALY, \$91 674 per QALY, and \$380 358 per QALY for favorable, moderately favorable, and least-favorable scenarios, respectively. Models were robust at a willingness-to-pay threshold of \$100 000 per QALY, with 95.5\%, 75.0\%, and 2.1\% of simulations below the threshold for favorable, moderately favorable, and least-favorable scenarios, respectively. Transferring patients with intracerebral hemorrhage to centers with specialized neuro-ICUs is cost-effective if observational estimates of the neuro-ICU\textendash based functional outcome distribution are accurate. If future work confirms these functional outcome distributions, then a strong societal rationale exists to build systems of care designed to transfer intracerebral hemorrhage patients to specialized neuro-ICUs.}

All parameters relevant to this analysis, including age, prehospital status (according to the modified Rankin Scale, mRS), International Classification of Diseases\textendash based diagnosis, and pretreatment with antiplatelet agents or oral anticoagulants, were recorded prospectively. Main outcome measures were in-hospital mortality rate and functional status at hospital discharge (mRS).Results\textemdash{} Over a 2-year period, 1691 patients with ICH (ICD-10: I61) were documented (48\% female; mean age, 72{$\pm$}12 years).

By univariate logistic regression, pretreatment with antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants was found to be a significant predictor of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.42; P=0.008; OR, 1.53; P{$<$}0.001) and of an unfavorable functional outcome (defined as mRS {$>$}2 or death; OR, 1.33, P=0.039; OR, 1.51; P{$<$}0.001).

Standardizing clinical practice, telemedicine, and organizing critical care service at a health system level improves outcomes. We developed a health system Critical Care Program based at an academic medical center. The main feature of our program is an intensivist who shares on-site and telemedicine clinical responsibilities. Tele-ICU facilitates the standardization of high-quality critical care across the system. A common electronic medical record made the communications among the ICUs feasible. Combining faculty from medical and surgical critical care divisions increased the productivity of intensivists.Study DesignWe retrospectively reviewed the administrative database data from 2011 and 2012, including mean census, number of transfers, age, sex, case mix index, mortality, readmissions, and financial data.ResultsThe Critical Care program has 106 adult ICU beds; 54 of those beds can be managed remotely using tele-ICU based at the main University hospital. The mean midnight census of the system for 2012 was 69.44 and total patient-days were 34,406. The capital cost of the tele-ICU was \$1,186,220. The annual operational cost is \$1,250,112 or \$23,150 per monitored ICU-bed. Unadjusted mortality was 6.5\% before and 4.9\% after implementation (p {$<$} 0.0002).ConclusionsWe describe a novel health system level ICU program built using ``off the shelf'' technology based on a large University medical center and a tele-ICU with a full degree of treatment authority across the system.},

  abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lurasidone compared with quetiapine for treatment of delirium in critically ill patients. Design: Prospective, observational cohort study. Setting: Single-center community teaching hospital. Patients: Forty adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients with delirium (Confusion Assessment Method in the ICU positive), tolerating enteral nutrition, and without active alcohol withdrawal or prior use of atypical antipsychotics. Interventions: Patients were treated at the discretion of the prescriber with either lurasidone or quetiapine for delirium. Dose escalation and/or discontinuation were determined at the discretion of individual providers. Results: Baseline characteristics differed with a higher severity of illness in patients in the quetiapine group (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 20) and a higher baseline QTc interval in the lurasidone group (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 20). No significant difference was seen in the time to delirium resolution (3.2 vs 3.4 days), average daily haloperidol requirements (5.7 vs 6.9 mg), hospital length of stay (LOS; 23.6 vs 27.9 days), or ICU LOS (12.1 vs 14.2 days). Lurasidone was associated with fewer ventilator support days (4.0 [interquartile range, IQR: 2.3-6.8] days vs 7 [IQR: 4.0-9.8; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .0295] days) but also a fewer number of deliriumfree days (0 [IQR: 0-1.0] days vs 2 [IQR: 0-3.0; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .0231] days). Additionally, no difference was seen for ICU mortality (20\% vs 20\%), percentage of time oversedated (2.8\% vs 2.7\%), or incidence of QTc prolongation (10.0\% vs 10.0\%). Conclusions: Lurasidone for the treatment of delirium in critically ill patients did not differ in the time to delirium resolution when compared to quetiapine. Additionally, the incidence of QTc prolongation between agents does not appear to be different. Future randomized trials should evaluate dose escalation schemes and a larger proportion of patients to evaluate differences in mortality, efficacy, and life-threatening arrhythmias associated with atypical antipsychotic use.},

  abstract = {Background: Regulators are evaluating the use of non-interventional real-world evidence (RWE) studies to assess the effectiveness of medical products. The RCT-DUPLICATE initiative uses a structured process to design RWE studies emulating randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and compare results. Here, we report findings of the first 10 trial emulations, evaluating cardiovascular outcomes of antidiabetic or antiplatelet medications. Methods: We selected 3 active-controlled and 7 placebo-controlled RCTs for replication. Using patient-level claims data from US commercial and Medicare payers, we implemented inclusion/exclusion criteria, selected primary endpoints, and comparator populations to emulate those of each corresponding RCT. Within the trial-mimicking populations, we conducted propensity score matching to control for {$>$}120 pre-exposure confounders. All study parameters were prospectively defined and protocols registered before hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed. Success criteria for the primary analysis were prespecified for each replication. Results: Despite attempts to emulate RCT design as closely as possible, differences between the RCT and corresponding RWE study populations remained. The regulatory conclusions were equivalent in 6 of 10. The RWE emulations achieved a HR estimate that was within the 95\% CI from the corresponding RCT in 8 of 10 studies. In 9 of 10, either the regulatory or estimate agreement success criteria were fulfilled. The largest differences in effect estimates were found for RCTs where second-generation sulfonylureas were used as a proxy for placebo regarding cardiovascular effects. Nine of 10 replications had a standardized difference between effect estimates of {$<$}2, which suggests differences within expected random variation. Conclusions: Agreement between RCT and RWE findings varies depending on which agreement metric is used. Interim findings indicate that selection of active comparator therapies with similar indications and use patterns enhances the validity of RWE. Even in the context of active comparators, concordance between RCT and RWE findings is not guaranteed, partially because trials are not emulated exactly. More trial emulations are needed to understand how often and in what contexts RWE findings match RCTs.

  abstract = {Objectives: The postoperative management of patients who undergo brain tumor resection frequently occurs in an ICU. However, the routine admission of all patients to an ICU following surgery is controversial. This study seeks to identify the frequency with which patients undergoing elective supratentorial tumor resection require care, aside from frequent neurologic checks, that is specific to an ICU and to determine the frequency of new complications during ICU admission. Additionally, clinical predictors of ICU-specific care are identified, and a scoring system to discriminate patients most likely to require ICU-specific treatment is validated. Design: Retrospective observational cohort study. Setting: Academic neurosurgical center. Patients: Two-hundred consecutive adult patients who underwent supratentorial brain tumor surgery. An additional 100 consecutive patients were used to validate the prediction score. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Univariate statistics and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify clinical characteristics associated with ICU-specific treatment. Eighteen patients (9\&percnt;) received ICU-specific care, and 19 (9.5\&percnt;) experienced new complications or underwent emergent imaging while in the ICU. Factors significantly associated with ICU-specific care included nonelective admission, preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale, and volume of IV fluids. A simple clinical scoring system that included Karnofsky Performance Status less than 70 (1 point), general endotracheal anesthesia (1 point), and any early postoperative complications (2 points) demonstrated excellent ability to discriminate patients who required ICU-specific care in both the derivation and validation cohorts. Conclusions: Less than 10\&percnt; of patients required ICU-specific care following supratentorial tumor resection. A simple clinical scoring system may aid clinicians in stratifying the risk of requiring ICU care and could inform triage decisions when ICU bed availability is limited.},

The p-value function provides familiar inference objects: significance levels, confidence intervals, critical values for fixed-level tests, and the power function at all values of the parameter of interest. It thus gives an immediate accurate and visual summary of inference information for the parameter of interest.

  abstract = {Background: The responsibility for helping patients understand potential health benefits and risks, especially regarding screening tests, falls largely to general practitioners (GPs). The Berlin Numeracy Test (BNT) specifically measures risk literacy (i.e., the ability to understand different aspects of statistical numeracy associated with accurate interpretation of information about risks). This study explored the association between risk literacy levels and clinical experience in GPs vs. medical students. Additionally, the effect of GP risk literacy on evaluation of the predictive value of screening tests was examined. Methods: The participants were 84 GPs and 92 third-year medical students who completed the BNT (total score range 0\textendash 4 points). The GPs received an additional case scenario on mammography screening as a simple measure of performance in applying numeracy skills. Results: Despite having an average of 25.9 years of clinical experience, GPs scored no better than medical students on risk literacy (GPs: 2.33 points, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.08\textendash 2.59; students: 2.34, 95\% CI 2.07\textendash 2.61; P = .983). Of all GPs, 71.6\% (n = 58) greatly overestimated the real predictive value. Conclusions: In this study, we found no difference in risk literacy between current students and current GPs. GPs lack risk literacy and consequently do not fully understand numeric estimates of probability in routine screening procedures.},

Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We conducted a retrospective, multicenter, observational cohort study among patients with reverse transcriptase\textendash polymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized at four New York City hospitals in the same health network between March 1, 2020, and May 20, 2020. TME was diagnosed in patients with altered mental status off sedation or after an adequate sedation washout. Patients with structural brain disease, seizures, or primary neurological diagnoses were excluded. The coprimary outcomes were the prevalence of TME stratified by etiology and in-hospital mortality (excluding comfort care only patients) assessed by using a multivariable time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for age, race, sex, intubation, intensive care unit requirement, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, hospital location, and date of admission. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Among 4491 patients with COVID-19, 559 (12\%) were diagnosed with TME, of whom 435 of 559 (78\%) developed encephalopathy immediately prior to hospital admission. The most common etiologies were septic encephalopathy (n\,=\,247 of 559 [62\%]), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) (n\,=\,331 of 559 [59\%]), and uremia (n\,=\,156 of 559 [28\%]). Multiple etiologies were present in 435 (78\%) patients. Compared with those without TME (n\,=\,3932), patients with TME were older (76 vs. 62 years), had dementia (27\% vs. 3\%) or psychiatric history (20\% vs. 10\%), were more often intubated (37\% vs. 20\%), had a longer hospital length of stay (7.9 vs. 6.0 days), and were less often discharged home (25\% vs. 66\% [all P\,{$<$}\,0.001]). Excluding comfort care patients (n\,=\,267 of 4491 [6\%]) and after adjustment for confounders, TME remained associated with increased risk of in-hospital death (n\,=\,128 of 425 [30\%] patients with TME died, compared with n\,=\,600 of 3799 [16\%] patients without TME; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.24, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.02\textendash 1.52, P\,=\,0.031), and TME due to hypoxemia conferred the highest risk (n\,=\,97 of 233 [42\%] patients with HIE died, compared with n\,=\,631 of 3991 [16\%] patients without HIE; aHR 1.56, 95\% CI 1.21\textendash 2.00, P\,=\,0.001). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} TME occurred in one in eight hospitalized patients with COVID-19, was typically multifactorial, and was most often due to hypoxemia, sepsis, and uremia. After we adjustment for confounding factors, TME was associated with a 24\% increased risk of in-hospital mortality.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of HES 130/0.4 compared with 0.9\% saline for intravascular volume expansion on mortality and postoperative complications after major abdominal surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial of 775 adult patients at increased risk of postoperative kidney injury undergoing major abdominal surgery at 20 university hospitals in France from February 2016 to July 2018; final follow-up was in October 2018. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to receive fluid containing either 6\% HES 130/0.4 diluted in 0.9\% saline (n = 389) or 0.9\% saline alone (n = 386) in 250-mL boluses using an individualized hemodynamic algorithm during surgery and for up to 24 hours on the first postoperative day, defined as ending at 7:59 AM the following day. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was a composite of death or major postoperative complications at 14 days after surgery. Secondary outcomes included predefined postoperative complications within 14 days after surgery, durations of intensive care unit and hospital stays, and all-cause mortality at postoperative days 28 and 90. RESULTS Among 826 patients enrolled (mean age, 68 [SD, 7] years; 91 women [12\%]), 775 (94\%) completed the trial. The primary outcome occurred in 139 of 389 patients (36\%) in the HES group and 125 of 386 patients (32\%) in the saline group (difference, 3.3\% [95\% CI, -3.3\% to 10.0\%]; relative risk, 1.10 [95\% CI, 0.91-1.34]; P = .33). Among 12 prespecified secondary outcomes reported, 11 showed no significant difference, but a statistically significant difference was found in median volume of study fluid administered on day 1: 1250 mL (interquartile range, 750-2000 mL) in the HES group and 1500 mL (interquartile range, 750-2150 mL) in the saline group (median difference, 250 mL [95\% CI, 83-417 mL]; P = .006). At 28 days after surgery, 4.1\% and 2.3\% of patients had died in the HES and saline groups, respectively (difference, 1.8\% [95\% CI, -0.7\% to 4.3\%]; relative risk, 1.76 [95\% CI, 0.79-3.94]; P = .17). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients at risk of postoperative kidney injury undergoing major abdominal surgery, use of HES for volume replacement therapy compared with 0.9\% saline resulted in no significant difference in a composite outcome of death or major postoperative complications within 14 days after surgery. These findings do not support the use of HES for volume replacement therapy in such patients.},

Participants                                Patients had a baseline eGFR between 10 and 20 mL/min/1.73 m                 2                 and were included between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2016, with follow-up until 1 June 2017.

A dynamic marginal structural model was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios and absolute risks for five year all cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke) for 15 dialysis initiation strategies with eGFR values between 4 and 19 mL/min/1.73 m                 2                 in increments of 1 mL/min/1.73 m                 2                 . An eGFR between 6 and 7 mL/min/1.73 m                 2                 (eGFR                 6-7                 ) was taken as the reference.                                                        Results                                Among 10\,290 incident patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (median age 73 years; 3739 (36\%) women; median eGFR 16.8 mL/min/1.73 m                 2                 ), 3822 started dialysis, 4160 died, and 2446 had a major adverse cardiovascular event. A parabolic relation was observed for mortality, with the lowest risk for eGFR                 15-16                 . Compared with dialysis initiation at eGFR                 6-7                 , initiation at eGFR                 15-16                 was associated with a 5.1\% (95\% confidence interval 2.5\% to 6.9\%) lower absolute five year mortality risk and 2.9\% (0.2\% to 5.5\%) lower risk of a major adverse cardiovascular event, corresponding to hazard ratios of 0.89 (95\% confidence interval 0.87 to 0.92) and 0.94 (0.91 to 0.98), respectively. This 5.1\% absolute risk difference corresponded to a mean postponement of death of 1.6 months over five years of follow-up. However, dialysis would need to be started four years earlier. When emulating the intended strategies of the Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) trial (eGFR                 10-14                 v                 eGFR                 5-7                 ) and the achieved eGFRs in IDEAL (eGFR                 7-10                 v                 eGFR                 5-7                 ), hazard ratios for all cause mortality were 0.96 (0.94 to 0.99) and 0.97 (0.94 to 1.00), respectively, which are congruent with the findings of the randomised IDEAL trial.                                                        Conclusions               Very early initiation of dialysis was associated with a modest reduction in mortality and cardiovascular events. For most patients, such a reduction may not outweigh the burden of a substantially longer period spent on dialysis.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To describe and summarise how the results of randomized controlled trials that did not find a significant treatment effect are reported, and to estimate how commonly trial reports make unwarranted claims. Design: We performed a retrospective survey of published RCTs, published in four high impact factor general medical journals between June 2016 and June 2017. Setting: Trials conducted in all settings were included. Participants: 94 reports of randomised controlled trials that did not find a difference in their main comparison or comparisons were included. Interventions: All interventions. Primary and secondary outcomes: We recorded the way each trial's results for its primary outcome or outcomes were described in the Results and Conclusions sections of the Abstract, using a 10-category classification. Other outcomes were whether confidence intervals and p-values were presented for the main treatment comparisons, and whether the results and conclusions referred to measures of uncertainty. We estimated the proportion of papers that made claims that were not justified by the results, or were open to multiple interpretations. Results: 94 trial reports (120 treatment comparisons) were included. In the Results sections, for 58/120 comparisons (48.3\%) the study's results were re-stated, without interpretation, and 38/120 (31.7\%) stated that there was not a statistically significant difference. In the Conclusions, 65/120 treatment comparisons (54.2\%) stated that there was no treatment benefit, 14/120 (11.7\%) that there was no significant benefit, and 16/120 (13.3\%) that there was no significant difference. Confidence intervals and pvalues were both presented by 84\% of studies (79/94), but only 3/94 studies referred to uncertainty when drawing conclusions. Conclusions: The majority of trials (54.2\%) inappropriately interpreted a result that was not statistically significant as indicating no treatment benefit. Very few studies interpreted the result as indicating a lack of evidence against the null hypothesis of zero difference between the trial arms.},

However, in a world in which measurements are noisy and effects are small, this will not work: selection on statistical significance leads to effect sizes which are overestimated and often in the wrong direction. After a brief discussion of two examples, one in economics and one in social psychology, we consider the procedural solution of open post-publication review, the design solution of devoting more effort to accurate measurements and within-person comparisons, and the statistical analysis solution of multilevel modeling and reporting all results rather than selection on significance. We argue that the current replication crisis in science arises in part from the ill effects of null hypothesis significance testing being used to study small effects with noisy data. In such settings, apparent success comes easy but truly replicable results require a more serious connection between theory, measurement, and data.},

Except for results of the open-label, single-arm ANNEXA-4 study, published real-world utilization of andexanet alfa is limited. We present our experience with andexanet alfa use in factor Xa inhibitor associated intracranial hemorrhage. The objective of this study was to assess the hemostatic efficacy and safety following early implementation of andexanet alfa use in factor Xa inhibitor associated intracranial hemorrhage. Methods: Single center, retrospective, observational study at a large community teaching hospital and Comprehensive Stroke Center. Consecutive patients with factor Xa inhibitor associated intracranial hemorrhage, spontaneous or traumatic, treated with andexanet alfa. Primary outcome was hemostatic efficacy established by categories of hematoma growth between baseline and follow-up head computerized tomography after andexanet alfa treatment. Safety outcomes included inpatient mortality and 30-day readmission due to a thromboembolic event. Consecutive factor Xa inhibitor associated intracranial hemorrhage treated with andexanet alfa presenting between June 2018 and December 2019 were included. Results: Thirty-nine patients with mean age of 81.9 years and median baseline Glasgow Coma Score of 14 were evaluated. Median (IQR) baseline intracerebral hematoma volume was 7.1 mL (2.3-28.5), while baseline thickness for subdural hemorrhage was 12.5 mm (8.0-19.3). In 35 of 39 patients with repeat computerized tomography prior to surgical intervention, excellent/good hemostatic efficacy was seen in 29 (82.9\%). Excluded from the hemostatic efficacy estimate were four trauma patients who underwent hematoma evacuation prior to repeat head computerized tomography, nevertheless they had excellent hemostatic effectiveness without perioperative complications or rebleeding. Four (10.3\%) patients died during hospitalization and two (5.1\%) thrombotic events were observed. Conclusions: In this cohort of a real-world utilization of andexanet alfa for reversal of factor Xa inhibitors in patients presenting with intracranial hemorrhage, we observed a high excellent/good hemostatic efficacy rate and lower than reported inpatient mortality and 30-day readmission due to thromboembolism consistent with the findings reported in ANNEXA-4 study. Despite the lack of comparative group, our outcomes, most noticeably hemostatic efficacy and inpatient mortality are consistent with those reported in the literature.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate whether recombinant activated coagulation factor VII (rFVIIa) reduces hemorrhage expansion among patients with spot sign\textendash positive ICH. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In parallel investigator-initiated, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials in Canada (``Spot Sign'' Selection of Intracerebral Hemorrhage to Guide Hemostatic Therapy [SPOTLIGHT]) and the United States (The Spot Sign for Predicting and Treating ICH Growth Study [STOP-IT]) with harmonized protocols and a preplanned individual patient\textendash level pooled analysis, patients presenting to the emergency department with an acute primary spontaneous ICH and a spot sign on CT angiography were recruited. Data were collected from November 2010 to May 2016. Data were analyzed from November 2016 to May 2017. INTERVENTIONS Eligible patients were randomly assigned 80 {$\mu$}g/kg of intravenous rFVIIa or placebo as soon as possible within 6.5 hours of stroke onset. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Head CT at 24 hours assessed parenchymal ICH volume expansion from baseline (primary outcome) and total (ie, parenchymal plus intraventricular) hemorrhage volume expansion (secondary outcome). The pooled analysis compared hemorrhage expansion between groups by analyzing 24-hour volumes in a linear regression model adjusted for baseline volumes, time from stroke onset to treatment, and trial. RESULTS Of the 69 included patients, 35 (51\%) were male, and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 70 (59-80) years. Baseline median (IQR) ICH volumes were 16.3 (9.6-39.2) mL in the rFVIIa group and 20.4 (8.6-32.6) mL in the placebo group. Median (IQR) time from CT to treatment was 71 (57-96) minutes, and the median (IQR) time from stroke onset to treatment was 178 (138-197) minutes. The median (IQR) increase in ICH volume from baseline to 24 hours was small in both the rFVIIa group (2.5 [0-10.2] mL) and placebo group (2.6 [0-6.6] mL). After adjustment, there was no difference between groups on measures of ICH or total hemorrhage expansion. At 90 days, 9 of 30 patients in the rFVIIa group and 13 of 34 in the placebo group had died or were severely disabled (P = .60). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with spot sign\textendash positive ICH treated a median of about 3 hours from stroke onset, rFVIIa did not significantly improve radiographic or clinical outcomes.},

  abstract = {Causal inference has a central role in public health; the determination that an association is causal indicates the possibility for intervention. We review and comment on the long-used guidelines for interpreting evidence as supporting a causal association and contrast them with the potential outcomes framework that encourages thinking in terms of causes that are interventions. We argue that in public health this framework is more suitable, providing an estimate of an action's consequences rather than the less precise notion of a risk factor's causal effect. A variety of modern statistical methods adopt this approach. When an intervention cannot be specified, causal relations can still exist, but how to intervene to change the outcome will be unclear. In application, the often-complex structure of causal processes needs to be acknowledged and appropriate data collected to study them. These newer approaches need to be brought to bear on the increasingly complex public health challenges of our globalized world.},

  abstract = {Pregnancy is associated with a number of pathophysiological changes (including modification of vascular resistance, increased vascular permeability, and coagulative disorders) that can lead to specific (eclampsia, preeclampsia) or not specific (intracranial hemorrhage) neurological complications. In addition to these disorders, pregnancy can affect numerous preexisting neurologic conditions, including epilepsy, brain tumors, and intracerebral bleeding from cerebral aneurysm or arteriovenous malformations. Intracranial complications related to pregnancy can expose patients to a high risk of intracranial hypertension (IHT). Unfortunately, at present, the therapeutic measures that are generally adopted for the control of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in the general population have not been examined in pregnant patients, and their efficacy and safety for the mother and the fetus is still unknown. In addition, no specific guidelines for the application of the staircase approach, including escalating treatments with increasing intensity of level, for the management of IHT exist for this population. Although some of basic measures can be considered safe even in pregnant patients (management of stable hemodynamic and respiratory function, optimization of systemic physiology), some other interventions, such as hyperventilation, osmotic therapy, hypothermia, barbiturates, and decompressive craniectomy, can lead to specific concerns for the safety of both mother and fetus. The aim of this review is to summarize the neurological pathophysiological changes occurring during pregnancy and explore the effects of the possible therapeutic interventions applied to the general population for the management of IHT during pregnancy, taking into consideration ethical and clinical concerns as well as the decision for the timing of treatment and delivery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have shown a positive benefit-risk balance in both clinical trials and real-world data, but approximately 2\% to 3.5\% of patients experience major bleeding annually. Many of these patients require hospitalization, and the administration of reversal agents may be required to control bleeding. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes associated with the use of 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrates, idarucizumab, or andexanet for reversal of severe DOAC-associated bleeding. METHODS The investigators systematically searched for studies of reversal agents for the treatment of severe bleeding associated with DOAC. Mortality rates, thromboembolic events, and hemostatic efficacy were meta-analyzed using a random effects model. RESULTS The investigators evaluated 60 studies in 4,735 patients with severe DOAC-related bleeding who were treated with 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2,688), idarucizumab (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1,111), or andexanet (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 936). The mortality rate was 17.7\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 15.1\% to 20.4\%), and it was higher in patients with intracranial bleedings (20.2\%) than in patients with extracranial hemorrhages (15.4\%). The thromboembolism rate was 4.6\% (95\% CI: 3.3\% to 6.0\%), being particularly high with andexanet (10.7\%; 95\% CI: 6.5\% to 15.7\%). The effective hemostasis rate was 78.5\% (95\% CI: 75.1\% to 81.8\%) and was similar regardless of the reversal agent considered. The rebleeding rate was 13.2\% (95\% CI: 5.5\% to 23.1\%) and 78\% of rebleeds occurred after resumption of anticoagulation. The risk of death was markedly and significantly associated with failure to achieve effective hemostasis (relative risk: 3.63; 95\% CI: 2.56 to 5.16). The results were robust regardless of the type of study or the hemostatic scale used. CONCLUSIONS The risk of death after severe DOAC-related bleeding remains significant despite a high rate of effective hemostasis with reversal agents. Failure to achieve effective hemostasis strongly correlated with a fatal outcome. Thromboembolism rates are particularly high with andexanet. Comparative clinical trials are needed.

  abstract = {Background Vitamin K antagonists are highly effective in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation but have several limitations. Apixaban is a novel oral direct factor Xa inhibitor that has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke in a similar population in comparison with aspirin. Methods In this randomized, double-blind trial, we compared apixaban (at a dose of 5 mg twice daily) with warfarin (target international normalized ratio, 2.0 to 3.0) in 18,201 patients with atrial fibrillation and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. The primary outcome was ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism. The trial was designed to test for noninferiority, with key secondary objectives of testing for superiority with respect to the primary outcome and to the rates of major bleeding and death from any cause. Results The median duration of follow-up was 1.8 years. The rate of the primary outcome was 1.27\% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 1.60\% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio with apixaban, 0.79; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.95; P{$<$}0.001 for noninferiority; P\,=\,0.01 for superiority). The rate of major bleeding was 2.13\% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 3.09\% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.60 to 0.80; P{$<$}0.001), and the rates of death from any cause were 3.52\% and 3.94\%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.80 to 0.99; P\,=\,0.047). The rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.24\% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 0.47\% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95\% CI, 0.35 to 0.75; P{$<$}0.001), and the rate of ischemic or uncertain type of stroke was 0.97\% per year in the apixaban group and 1.05\% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.74 to 1.13; P\,=\,0.42).

Results:\hspace{0.6em} The adjusted mean difference on days alive without life support at day 28 (primary outcome) was 1.3 days (95\% CrI -0.3 to 2.9; 94.2\% probability of benefit). Adjusted relative risks and probabilities of benefit on seri-ous adverse reactions was 0.85 (0.63 to 1.16; 84.1\%) and on mortality 0.87 (0.73 to 1.03; 94.8\%) at day 28 and 0.88 (0.75 to 1.02; 95.1\%) at day 90. Probabilities of benefit on days alive without life support and days alive out of hospital at day 90 were 85 and 95.7\%, respectively. Results were largely consistent across sensitivity analyses, with relatively low probabilities of clinically important harm with 12 mg on all outcomes in all analyses.},

  abstract = {Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for providing unbiased evidence of intervention effects. Here, we provide an overview of the history of RCTs and discuss the major challenges and limitations of current critical care RCTs, including overly optimistic effect sizes; unnuanced conclusions based on dichotomization of results; limited focus on patient-centred outcomes other than mortality; lack of flexibility and ability to adapt, increasing the risk of inconclusive results and limiting knowledge gains before trial completion; and inefficiency due to lack of re-use of trial infrastructure. We discuss recent developments in critical care RCTs and novel methods that may provide solutions to some of these challenges, including a research programme approach (consecutive, complementary studies of multiple types rather than individual, independent studies), and novel design and analysis methods. These include standardization of trial protocols; alternative outcome choices and use of core outcome sets; increased acceptance of uncertainty, probabilistic interpretations and use of Bayesian statistics; novel approaches to assessing heterogeneity of treatment effects; adaptation and platform trials; and increased integration between clinical trials and clinical practice. We outline the advantages and discuss the potential methodological and practical disadvantages with these approaches. With this review, we aim to inform clinicians and researchers about conventional and novel RCTs, including the rationale for choosing one or the other methodological approach based on a thorough discussion of pros and cons. Importantly, the most central feature remains the randomisation, which provides unparalleled restriction of confounding compared to non-randomised designs by reducing confounding to chance.},

The 2004 PNS criteria are partially outdated due to advances in PNS research in the last 16 years leading to the identification of new phenotypes and antibodies that have transformed the diagnostic approach to PNS. Here, we propose updated diagnostic criteria for PNS. Methods A panel of experts developed by consensus a modified set of diagnostic PNS criteria for clinical decision making and research purposes. The panel reappraised the 2004 criteria alongside new knowledge on PNS obtained from published and unpublished data generated by the different laboratories involved in the project. Results The panel proposed to substitute ``classical syndromes'' with the term ``high-risk phenotypes'' for cancer and introduce the concept of ``intermediate-risk phenotypes.'' The term ``onconeural antibody'' was replaced by ``high risk'' ({$>$}70\% associated with cancer) and ``intermediate risk'' (30\%\textendash 70\% associated with cancer) antibodies. The panel classified 3 levels of evidence for PNS: definite, probable, and possible. Each level can be reached by using the PNS-Care Score, which combines clinical phenotype, antibody type, the presence or absence of cancer, and time of follow-up. With the exception of opsoclonus-myoclonus, the diagnosis of definite PNS requires the presence of high- or intermediate-risk antibodies. Specific recommendations for similar syndromes triggered by immune checkpoint inhibitors are also provided. Conclusions The proposed criteria and recommendations should be used to enhance the clinical care of patients with PNS and to encourage standardization of research initiatives addressing PNS.},

This paper explores some competing mental models of how infectious diseases spread and shows how these models influenced the scientific process and the kinds of facts that were generated, legitimized and used to support policy. A central theme in the paper is the relative weight given by dominant scientific voices to probabilistic arguments based on experimental measurements versus mechanistic arguments based on theory. Two examples are explored: the cholera epidemic in nineteenth century London\textemdash in which the story of John Snow and the Broad Street pump is retold\textemdash and the unfolding of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and early 2021\textemdash in which the evidence-based medicine movement and its hierarchy of evidence features prominently.

However, null P values still thrive in most journals and are routinely misinterpreted as probabilities of a ``chance finding'' or of the null, when they are no such thing. This misuse may be lessened by recognizing correct Bayesian interpretations. For example, under weak priors, 95\% confidence intervals approximate 95\% posterior probability intervals, one-sided P values approximate directional posterior probabilities, and point estimates approximate posterior medians. Furthermore, under certain conditions, a one-sided P value for a prior median provides an approximate lower bound on the posterior probability that the point estimate is on the wrong side of that median. More generally, P values can be incorporated into a modern analysis framework that emphasizes measurement of fit, distance, and posterior probability in place of ``statistical significance'' and accept/reject decisions.},

Data Sources:~         PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and CENTRAL from inception to September 15, 2018.         Study Selection:~         Adult studies validating the Intracerebral Hemorrhage score for mortality prediction in nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage at 1 month/discharge or sooner.         Data Extraction:~         Data were collected on the following aspects of study design: population studied, level of care, timing of outcome measurement, mean study year, and mean cohort Intracerebral Hemorrhage score. The summary measures of interest were discrimination as assessed by the C-statistic and calibration as assessed by the standardized mortality ratio (observed:expected mortality ratio). Random effect models were used to pool both measures. Heterogeneity was measured using the I2 statistic and explored using subgroup analysis and meta-regression.         Data Synthesis:~         Fifty-five studies provided data on discrimination, and 35 studies provided data on calibration. Overall, the Intracerebral Hemorrhage score discriminated well (pooled C-statistic 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.82\textendash 0.85) but overestimated mortality (pooled observed:expected mortality ratio = 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.78\textendash 0.97), with high heterogeneity for both estimates (I2 80\% and 84\%, respectively). Discrimination was affected by study mean Intracerebral Hemorrhage score ({$\beta$} = \textendash 0.05), and calibration was affected by disease severity, with the score overestimating mortality for patients with an Intracerebral Hemorrhage score greater than 3 (observed:expected mortality ratio = 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.78\textendash 0.91). Mortality rates were reproducible across cohorts for patients with an Intracerebral Hemorrhage score 0\textendash 1 (I2 = 15\%).         Conclusions:~         The Intracerebral Hemorrhage score is a valid clinical prediction rule for short-term mortality in intracerebral hemorrhage patients but discriminated mortality worse in more severe cohorts. It also overestimated mortality in the highest Intracerebral Hemorrhage score patients, with significant inconsistency between cohorts. These results suggest that mortality for these patients is dependent on factors not included in the score. Further studies are needed to determine these factors.},

  abstract = {The role of non-invasive respiratory support (high-flow nasal oxygen and noninvasive ventilation) in the manage-ment of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome is debated. The oxygenation improvement coupled with lung and diaphragm protection produced by non-invasive support may help to avoid endotracheal intubation, which prevents the complications of sedation and invasive mechanical ventilation. However, spontaneous breathing in patients with lung injury carries the risk that vigorous inspiratory effort, combined or not with mechanical increases in inspiratory airway pressure, produces high transpulmonary pressure swings and local lung overstretch. This ultimately results in additional lung damage (patient self-inflicted lung injury), so that patients intubated after a trial of noninvasive support are burdened by increased mortality. Reducing inspiratory effort by high-flow nasal oxygen or delivery of sustained positive end-expiratory pressure through the helmet interface may reduce these risks. In this physiology-to-bedside review, we provide an updated overview about the role of nonin-vasive respiratory support strategies as early treatment of hypoxemic respiratory failure in the intensive care unit. Noninvasive strategies appear safe and effective in mild-to-moderate hypoxemia \-(PaO2/FiO2\,{$>$}\,150 mmHg), while they can yield delayed intubation with increased mortality in a significant proportion of moderate-to-severe (\-PaO2/ FiO2\,{$\leq$}\,150 mmHg) cases. High-flow nasal oxygen and helmet noninvasive ventilation represent the most promising techniques for first-line treatment of severe patients. However, no conclusive evidence allows to recommend a single approach over the others in case of moderate-to-severe hypoxemia. During any treatment, strict physiological moni-toring remains of paramount importance to promptly detect the need for endotracheal intubation and not delay protective ventilation.},

Studies have used datasets sampled from patients admitted to hospital, people tested for active infection, or people who volunteered to participate. Here, we highlight the challenge of interpreting observational evidence from such non-representative samples. Collider bias can induce associations between two or more variables which affect the likelihood of an individual being sampled, distorting associations between these variables in the sample. Analysing UK Biobank data, compared to the wider cohort the participants tested for COVID-19 were highly selected for a range of genetic, behavioural, cardiovascular, demographic, and anthropometric traits. We discuss the mechanisms inducing these problems, and approaches that could help mitigate them. While collider bias should be explored in existing studies, the optimal way to mitigate the problem is to use appropriate sampling strategies at the study design stage.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To test whether tocilizumab decreases mortality in this population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The data for this study were derived from a multicenter cohort study of 4485 adults with COVID-19 admitted to participating intensive care units (ICUs) at 68 hospitals across the US from March 4 to May 10, 2020. Critically ill adults with COVID-19 were categorized according to whether they received or did not receive tocilizumab in the first 2 days of admission to the ICU. Data were collected retrospectively until June 12, 2020. A Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting was used to adjust for confounding. EXPOSURES Treatment with tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Time to death, compared via hazard ratios (HRs), and 30-day mortality, compared via risk differences. RESULTS Among the 3924 patients included in the analysis (2464 male [62.8\%]; median age, 62 [interquartile range \{IQR\}, 52-71] years), 433 (11.0\%) received tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission. Patients treated with tocilizumab were younger (median age, 58 [IQR, 48-65] vs 63 [IQR, 52-72] years) and had a higher prevalence of hypoxemia on ICU admission (205 of 433 [47.3\%] vs 1322 of 3491 [37.9\%] with mechanical ventilation and a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen of {$<$}200 mm Hg) than patients not treated with tocilizumab. After applying inverse probability weighting, baseline and severity-of-illness characteristics were well balanced between groups. A total of 1544 patients (39.3\%) died, including 125 (28.9\%) treated with tocilizumab and 1419 (40.6\%) not treated with tocilizumab. In the primary analysis, during a median follow-up of 27 (IQR, 14-37) days, patients treated with tocilizumab had a lower risk of death compared with those not treated with tocilizumab (HR, 0.71; 95\% CI, 0.56-0.92). The estimated 30-day mortality was 27.5\% (95\% CI, 21.2\%-33.8\%) in the tocilizumab-treated patients and 37.1\% (95\% CI, 35.5\%-38.7\%) in the non-tocilizumab\textendash treated patients (risk difference, 9.6\%; 95\% CI, 3.1\%-16.0\%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this cohort study, the risk of in-hospital mortality in this study was lower in patients treated with tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission compared with patients whose treatment did not include early use of tocilizumab. However, the findings may be susceptible to unmeasured confounding, and further research from randomized clinical trials is needed.},

We describe our experience implementing an early neurorehabilitation protocol for patients with COVID-19-associated DoC in the intensive care unit (ICU) and evaluate factors associated with recovery. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} During the initial COVID-19 surge in New York City between March 10 and May 20, 2020, faced with a disproportionately high number of ICU patients with prolonged unresponsiveness, we developed and implemented an early neurorehabilitation protocol, applying standard practices from brain injury rehabilitation care to the ICU setting. Twenty-one patients with delayed recovery of consciousness after severe COVID-19 participated in a pilot early neurorehabilitation program that included serial Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) assessments, multimodal treatment, and access to clinicians specializing in brain injury medicine. We retrospectively compared clinical features of patients who did and did not recover to the minimally conscious state (MCS) or better, defined as a CRS-R total score (TS)\,{$\geq$}\,8, before discharge. We additionally examined factors associated with best CRS-R TS, last CRS-R TS, hospital length of stay, and time on mechanical ventilation. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Patients underwent CRS-R assessments a median of six (interquartile range [IQR] 3\textendash 10) times before discharge, beginning a median of 48 days (IQR 40\textendash 55) from admission. Twelve (57\%) patients recovered to MCS after a median of 8 days (IQR 2\textendash 14) off continuous sedation; they had lower body mass index (p\,=\,0.009), lower peak serum C-reactive protein levels (p\,=\,0.023), higher minimum arterial partial pressure of oxygen (p\,=\,0.028), and earlier fentanyl discontinuation (p\,=\,0.018). CRS-R scores fluctuated over time, and the best CRS-R TS was significantly higher than the last CRS-R TS (median 8 [IQR 5\textendash 23] vs. 5 [IQR 3\textendash 18], p\,=\,0.002). Earlier fentanyl (p\,=\,0.001) and neuromuscular blockade (p\,=\,0.015) discontinuation correlated with a higher last CRS-R TS. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} More than half of our cohort of patients with prolonged unresponsiveness following severe COVID19 recovered to MCS or better before hospital discharge, achieving a clinical benchmark known to have relatively favorable long-term prognostic implications in DoC of other etiologies.

METHODS: We identified patients with BAVM at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health maintenance organization and documented their clinical course. The influences of age at diagnosis, gender, race-ethnicity, ICH at presentation, venous draining pattern, and BAVM size on ICH subsequent to presentation were studied using the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: We identified 790 patients with BAVM (51\% female; 63\% white; mean age+/-SD at diagnosis: 38+/-19 years) between 1961 and 2001. Patients who presented with ICH experienced a higher rate of subsequent ICH than those who presented without ICH under multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 3.6; 95\% CI, 1.1 to 11.9; P{$<$}0.032). The effect was similar across race-ethnicity and gender. This difference in ICH rates was greatest in the first year (7\% versus 3\% per year) and converged over time. The effect of subsequent ICH on functional status was similar to that of the initial ICH. CONCLUSIONS: Presentation with ICH was the most important predictor of future ICH, confirming previous studies. Future ICH had similar impact on functional outcome as incident ICH. Intervention to prevent ICH would be of potentially greater benefit to patients presenting with ICH, although the advantage decreases over time.},

They advertise high-margin products aggressively and low-margin ones hardly at all. In modern macroeconomics, wedges are potent sources of fluctuations in employment. The profit margin or markup ratio is a leading example. In an important class of fluctuations models, profit margins rise in recessions and mediate the decline in employment. But a rise in profit margins should expand advertising by a lot. Really a lot. Advertising should be highly countercyclical. Instead, it is somewhat procyclical. The ratio of advertising spending to private GDP falls when the economy contracts. The behavior of advertising refutes the hypothesis that profit margins rise. But it is true that the labor share of income falls. Hence there must be another factor that lowers the labor share without raising profit margins. An influence that fits some of the facts is a rise in a product-market friction or wedge that has the same effect as an increase in sales taxes. The cyclical behavior of advertising should point macroeconomics in a somewhat different direction in explaining employment fluctuations.},

  abstract = {Background: The optimal resuscitative fluid remains controversial. Objective: To assess the association between crystalloid fluid and outcomes in critically ill adults. Methods: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials were searched from inception through July 2019. Cohort studies and randomized trials of critically ill adults provided predominantly nonperioperative fluid resuscitation with balanced crystalloids or 0.9\% sodium chloride (saline) were included. Results: Thirteen studies (n = 30 950) were included. Balanced crystalloids demonstrated lower hospital or 28-/30-day mortality (risk ratio [RR] = 0.86; 95\% CI = 0.750.99; I2 = 82\%) overall, in observational studies (RR = 0.64; 95\% CI = 0.41-0.99; I2 = 63\%), and approached significance in randomized trials (RR = 0.94; 95\% CI = 0.88-1.02; I2 = 0\%). New acute kidney injury occurred less frequently with balanced crystalloids (RR = 0.91; 95\% CI = 0.85-0.98; I2 = 0\%), though progression to renal replacement therapy was similar (RR = 0.91; 95\% CI = 0.79-1.04; I2 = 38\%). In the sepsis cohort, odds of hospital or 28-/30-day mortality were similar, but the odds of major adverse kidney events occurring in the first 30 days were less with balanced crystalloids than saline (OR = 0.78; 95\% CI = 0.66-0.91; I2 = 42\%). Conclusion and Relevance: Resuscitation with balanced crystalloids demonstrated lower hospital or 28-/30-day mortality compared with saline in critically ill adults but not specifically those with sepsis. Balanced crystalloids should be provided preferentially to saline in most critically ill adult patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The comparative efficacy and safety of balanced crystalloid solutions and saline for fluid therapy in critically ill adults remain uncertain. METHODS We systematically reviewed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing the use of balanced crystalloids with saline in critically ill adults. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality after pooling data from low-risk-of-bias trials using a random-effects model. We also performed a Bayesian meta-analysis to describe the primary treatment effect in probability terms. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), new treatment with renal replacement therapy (RRT), and ventilator-free and vasopressor-free days to day 28. RESULTS We identified 13 RCTs, comprising 35,884 participants. From six trials (34,450 participants) with a low risk of bias, the risk ratio (RR) for 90-day mortality with balanced crystalloids versus saline was 0.96 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.01; I2 5 12.1\%); using vague priors, the posterior probability that balanced crystalloids reduce mortality was 89.5\%. The RRs of developing AKI and of being treated with RRT with balanced crystalloids versus saline were 0.96 (95\% CI, 0.89 to 1.02) and 0.95 (95\% CI, 0.81 to 1.11), respectively. Ventilator-free days (mean difference, 0.18 days; 95\% CI, 20.45 to 0.81) and vasopressor-free days (mean difference, 0.19 days; 95\% CI, 20.14 to 0.51) were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS The estimated effect of using balanced crystalloids versus saline in critically ill adults ranges from a 9\% relative reduction to a 1\% relative increase in the risk of death, with a high probability that the average effect of using balanced crystalloids is to reduce mortality.

Radiologic imaging techniques are being developed for accurate detection and early diagnosis of disease, which will eventually affect patient outcomes. Hence, results obtained by radiological means, especially diagnostic imaging, are frequently incorporated into a clinical prediction model as important predictive parameters, and the performance of the prediction model may improve in both diagnostic and prognostic settings. This article explains in a conceptual manner the overall process of developing and validating a clinical prediction model involving radiological parameters in relation to the study design and statistical methods. Collection of a raw dataset; selection of an appropriate statistical model; predictor selection; evaluation of model performance using a calibration plot, Hosmer-Lemeshow test and c-index; internal and external validation; comparison of different models using c-index, net reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination improvement; and a method to create an easy-to-use prediction score system will be addressed.

  abstract = {Status epilepticus is a condition resulting either from the failure of the mechanisms responsible for seizure termination or from the initiation of mechanisms that lead to abnormally prolonged seizures and require urgent administration of antiepileptic drugs. Refractory status epilepticus requires anesthetics drugs and may lead to brain injury with molecular and cellular alterations (eg, inflammation, and neuronal and astroglial injury) that could induce neurologic sequels and further development of epilepsy. Outcome scores based on demographic, clinical, and electroencephalography (EEG) condition are available, allowing prediction of the risk of mortality, but the severity of brain injury in survivors is poorly evaluated. New biomarkers are needed to predict with higher accuracy the outcome of patients admitted with status in an intensive care unit. Here, we summarize the findings of studies from patients and animal models of status epilepticus. Specific protein markers can be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid and the blood. One of the first described markers of neuronal death is the neuron-specific enolase. Gliosis resulting from inflammatory responses after status can be detected through the increase of S100-beta, or some cytokines, like the High Mobility Group Box 1. Other proteins, like progranulin may reflect the neuroprotective mechanisms resulting from the brain adaptation to excitotoxicity. These new biomarkers aim to prospectively identify the severity and development of disability, and subsequent epilepsy of patients with status. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each biomarker, by evaluating their brain specificity, stability in the fluids, and sensitivity to external interferences, such as hemolysis. Finally, we emphasize the need for further development and validation of such biomarkers in order to better assess patients with severe status epilepticus.},

We therefore examined these issues in a population based cohort of 1 year ICH survivors. ICH patients in a defined Swedish population (1.14 million inhabitants) were prospectively registered during 1996. Patients surviving 1 year after ICH onset were followed-up regarding survival status and cause of death until December 2009 using data from the National Census Office and the National Cause of Death Register. Patient prognosis was also compared with the general population using official Swedish mortality data. Clinical and radiological prognostic factors were evaluated. Of 323 patients with ICH, 172 (53\%) survived after 1 year, 127 (39\%) after 5 years and 57 (18\%) after 13 years. Mortality of the 172, 1 year survivors (mean age 67.7 years at ICH) persistently exceeded expected mortality; 13 years post ictus survival was only 34\% compared with 61\% in the general population. Of 115 deaths among the 172, 1 year survivors, 36\% were from cerebrovascular disease and 19\% from ischaemic heart disease. Independent risk factors for death among 1 year survivors were age (HR 1.08 per year; 95\% CI 1.06 to 1.10; p{$<$}0.001), diabetes mellitus at baseline (HR 2.10; 95\% CI 1.18 to 3.74; p=0.012) and anticoagulant therapy (HR 1.99; 95\% CI 1.12 to 3.53; p=0.018) at ICH onset. One year survivors after ICH had a substantial and persisting excess mortality compared with the general population. Major causes of death were stroke and ischaemic heart disease.},

The goals of this study were to assess whether the ICH Score accurately stratifies patients with regard to 12-month functional outcome and to further delineate the pace of recovery of patients during the first year post-ICH. Methods: We performed a prospective observational cohort study of all patients with acute ICH admitted to the emergency departments of San Francisco General Hospital and UCSF Medical Center from June 1, 2001, through May 31, 2004. Components of the ICH Score (admission Glasgow Coma Scale score, initial hematoma volume, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage, infratentorial ICH origin, and age) were recorded along with other clinical characteristics. Patients were then assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at hospital discharge, 30 days, and 3, 6, and 12 months post-ICH. Results: Of 243 patients, 95 (39\%) died during initial acute hospitalization. The ICH Score accurately stratified patients with regard to 12-month functional outcome for various dichotomous cutpoints along the mRS (p Ͻ 0.05). Many patients continued to improve across the first year, with a small number of patients becoming disabled or dying due to late events unrelated to the initial ICH. Conclusions: The ICH Score is a valid clinical grading scale for long-term functional outcome after acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Many ICH patients improve after hospital discharge and this improvement may continue even after 6 months post-ICH. Neurology\textregistered{} 2009;73:1088 \textendash 1094},

This structure is shared by other biases (eg, adjustment for variables affected by prior exposure). A structural classification of bias distinguishes between biases resulting from conditioning on common effects (``selection bias'') and those resulting from the existence of common causes of exposure and outcome (``confounding''). This classification also leads to a unified approach to adjust for selection bias.},

The objectives of this International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) review were to 1) check the currency of, and where needed, update evidence for the domain of ``basing the information in decision aids on comprehensive, critically appraised, and up-to-date syntheses of the evidence''; 2) analyze the evidence characteristics of decision aids; and 3) propose updates to relevant IPDAS criteria.                                         Methods               We searched MEDLINE and PubMed to inform updates of this domain's definitions, justifications, and components. We also searched 5 sources to identify all publicly available decision aids ( N = 471). Two assessors independently extracted each aid's evidence characteristics.                                         Results               Minor updates to the definitions and theoretical justifications of this IPDAS domain are provided and changes to relevant IPDAS criteria proposed. Nearly all aids (97\%) provided a year of creation/update, but most (81\%) did not report an explicit update or expiration policy. No scientific references were cited in 33\% of aids. Of the 314 that cited at least 1 reference, 39\% cited at least 1 guideline, 44\% cited at least 1 systematic review, and 23\% cited at least 1 randomized trial. In 35\%, it was unclear what statement in the aid the citations referred to. Only 14\% reported any of the processes used to find and decide on evidence inclusion. Only 14\% reported the evidence quality. Many emerging issues and future research areas were identified.                                         Conclusions               Although many emerging issues need to be addressed, this IPDAS domain is validated and criteria refined. High-quality patient decision aids should be based on comprehensive and up-to-date syntheses of critically appraised evidence.},

We examine whether this racial bias is related to false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites (e.g., ``black people's skin is thicker than white people's skin''). Study 1 documented these beliefs among white laypersons and revealed that participants who more strongly endorsed false beliefs about biological differences reported lower pain ratings for a black (vs. white) target. Study 2 extended these findings to the medical context and found that half of a sample of white medical students and residents endorsed these beliefs. Moreover, participants who endorsed these beliefs rated the black (vs. white) patient's pain as lower and made less accurate treatment recommendations. Participants who did not endorse these beliefs rated the black (vs. white) patient's pain as higher, but showed no bias in treatment recommendations. These findings suggest that individuals with at least some medical training hold and may use false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites to inform medical judgments, which may contribute to racial disparities in pain assessment and treatment.},

Subgroup analyses were predetermined. Results: Among 3184 participants, 478 (15.0\%) died and 249 (7.8\%) had TAE. Additional blood transfusion was required in 517 (41.2\%) of 1256 subjects. Patients receiving rFVIIa were less likely to need additional blood transfusions (OR, 0.54; 95\% CI, 0.34 \textendash 0.86) than patients receiving placebo.

Reduction in mortality was more likely if rFVIIa was given therapeutically (OR, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.70 \textendash 1.09) rather than prophylactically (OR, 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.37\textendash 2.68). Differences in the pooled analysis of TAE were not statistically significant (OR, 1.17; 95\% CI, 0.87\textendash 1.58) but the incidence of arterial TAE was likely higher in patients receiving rFVIIa (OR, 1.50; 95\% CI, 0.93\textendash 2.41) although no differences were seen with respect to venous TAE (OR, 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.49 \textendash 1.15).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The inclusion of race in equations to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has become controversial. Alternative equations that can be used to achieve similar accuracy without the use of race are needed. METHODS In a large national study involving adults with chronic kidney disease, we conducted cross-sectional analyses of baseline data from 1248 participants for whom data, including the following, had been collected: race as reported by the participant, genetic ancestry markers, and the serum creatinine, serum cystatin C, and 24-hour urinary creatinine levels. RESULTS Using current formulations of GFR estimating equations, we found that in participants who identified as Black, a model that omitted race resulted in more underestimation of the GFR (median difference between measured and estimated GFR, 3.99 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.17 to 5.62) and lower accuracy (percent of estimated GFR within 10\% of measured GFR [P10], 31\%; 95\% CI, 24 to 39) than models that included race (median difference, 1.11 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95\% CI, -0.29 to 2.54; P10, 42\%; 95\% CI, 34 to 50). The incorporation of genetic ancestry data instead of race resulted in similar estimates of the GFR (median difference, 1.33 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95\% CI, -0.12 to 2.33; P10, 42\%; 95\% CI, 34 to 50). The inclusion of non-GFR determinants of the serum creatinine level (e.g., body-composition metrics and urinary excretion of creatinine) that differed according to race reported by the participants and genetic ancestry did not eliminate the misclassification introduced by removing race (or ancestry) from serum creatinine\textendash based GFR estimating equations. In contrast, the incorporation of race or ancestry was not necessary to achieve similarly statistically unbiased (median difference, 0.33 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95\% CI, -1.43 to 1.92) and accurate (P10, 41\%; 95\% CI, 34 to 49) estimates in Black participants when GFR was estimated with the use of cystatin C.

CONCLUSIONS The use of the serum creatinine level to estimate the GFR without race (or genetic ancestry) introduced systematic misclassification that could not be eliminated even when numerous non-GFR determinants of the serum creatinine level were accounted for. The estimation of GFR with the use of cystatin C generated similar results while eliminating the negative consequences of the current race-based approaches.

We compared the occurrence of HE and clinical outcomes in patients treated either with andexanet alfa or with usual care during the acute phase of factor-Xa inhibitor\textendash related ICH. METHODS: Data were extracted from the multicenter, prospective, single-arm ANNEXA-4 trial (Andexanet Alfa, a Novel Antidote to the Anticoagulation Effects of Factor Xa Inhibitors) and a multicenter observational cohort study, RETRACE-II (GermanWide Multicenter Analysis of Oral Anticoagulant-Associated Intracerebral Hemorrhage - Part Two). HE was based on computed tomography scans performed within 36 hours from baseline imaging. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was performed to adjust for baseline comorbidities and ICH severity. Patients presenting with atraumatic ICH while receiving apixaban or rivaroxaban within 18 hours of admission were included. Patients with secondary ICH or not fulfilling the inclusion criteria for the ANNEXA-4 trial were excluded. We compared ANNEXA-4 patients, who received andexanet alfa for hemostatic treatment, with RETRACE-II patients who were treated with usual care, primarily administration of prothrombin complex concentrates. Primary outcome was rate of HE defined as relative increase of {$\geq$}35\%. Secondary outcomes comprised mean absolute change in hematoma volume, as well as in-hospital mortality and functional outcome. RESULTS: Overall, 182 patients with factor-Xa inhibitor\textendash related ICH (85 receiving andexanet alfa versus 97 receiving usual care) were selected for analysis. There were no relevant differences regarding demographic or clinical characteristics between both groups. HE occurred in 11 of 80 (14\%) andexanet alfa patients compared with 21 of 67 (36\%) usual care patients (adjusted relative risk, 0.40 [95\% CI, 0.20\textendash 0.78]; P=0.005), with a reduction in mean overall hematoma volume change of 7 mL. There were no statistically significant differences among in-hospital mortality or functional outcomes. Sensitivity analysis including only usual care patients receiving prothrombin complex concentrates demonstrated consistent results. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with usual care, andexanet alfa was associated with a lower rate of HE in atraumatic factor-Xa inhibitor\textendash related ICH, however, without translating into significantly improved clinical outcomes. A comparative trial is needed to confirm the benefit on limiting HE and to explore clinical outcomes across patient subgroups and by time to treatment.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Targeted temperature management (TTM) is endorsed by various guidelines to improve neurologic outcomes following cardiac arrest. Shivering, a consequence of hypothermia, can counteract the benefits of TTM. Despite its frequent occurrence, consensus guidelines provide minimal guidance on the management of shivering. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a pharmacologic antishivering protocol in patients undergoing TTM following cardiac arrest on the incidence of shivering. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} A retrospective observational cohort study at a large academic medical center of adult patients who underwent TTM targeting 33 \textdegree C following out-of-hospital (OHCA) or in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) was conducted between January 2013 and January 2019. Patients were included in the preprotocol group if they received TTM prior to the initiation of a pharmacologic antishivering protocol in 2015. The primary outcome was incidence of shivering between pre- and postprotocol patients. Secondary outcomes included time from arrest (IHCA) or admission to the hospital (OHCA) to goal body temperature, total time spent at goal body temperature, and percentage of patients alive at discharge. All pharmacologic agents listed as part of the antishivering protocol were recorded. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Fifty-one patients were included in the preprotocol group, and 80 patients were included in the postprotocol group. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the groups, including percentage of patients experiencing OHCA (75\% vs. 63\%, p\,=\,0.15) and time from arrest to return of spontaneous circulation (17.5 vs. 17.9 min, p\,=\,0.96). Incidence of patients with shivering was significantly reduced in the postprotocol group (57\% vs. 39\%, p\,=\,0.03). Time from arrest (IHCA) or admission to the hospital (OHCA) to goal body temperature was similar in both groups (5.1 vs. 5.3 h, p\,=\,0.57), in addition to total time spent at goal body temperature (17.7 vs. 18 h, p\,=\,0.93). The percentage of patients alive at discharge was significantly improved in the postprotocol group (35\% vs. 55\%, p\,=\,0.02). Patients in the postprotocol group received significantly more buspirone (4\% vs. 73\%, p\,{$<$}\,0.01), meperidine (8\% vs. 34\%, p\,{$<$}\,0.01), and acetaminophen (12\% vs. 65\%, p\,{$<$}\,0.01) as part of the pharmacologic antishivering protocol. Use of neuromuscular blockade significantly decreased post protocol (19\% vs. 6\%, p\,=\,0.02). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} In patients undergoing TTM following cardiac arrest, the implementation of a pharmacologic antishivering protocol reduced the incidence of shivering and the use neuromuscular blocking agents.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Airway pressure release ventilation is a ventilatory mode characterized by a mandatory inverse inspiratory:expiratory ratio with a very short expiratory phase, aimed to avoid derecruitment and allow spontaneous breathing. Recent basic and clinical evidence suggests that this mode could be associated with improved outcomes in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes between airway pressure release ventilation and traditional ventilation targeting low tidal volume, in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Single-center randomized controlled trial. SETTING: ICU of a Mexican referral center dedicated to care of patients with confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019. PATIENTS: Ninety adult intubated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Within 48 hours after intubation, patients were randomized to either receive ventilatory management with airway pressure release ventilation or continue low tidal volume ventilation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-five patients in airway pressure release ventilation group and 45 in the low tidal volume group were included. Ventilator-free days were 3.7 (0\textendash 15) and 5.2 (0\textendash 19) in the airway pressure release ventilation and low tidal volume groups, respectively (p = 0.28). During the first 7 days, patients in airway pressure release ventilation had a higher Pao2/Fio2 (mean difference, 26 [95\%CI, 13\textendash 38]; p {$<$} 0.001) and static compliance (mean difference, 3.7\,mL/cm H2O [95\% CI, 0.2\textendash 7.2]; p = 0.03), higher mean airway pressure (mean difference, 3.1\,cm H2O [95\% CI, 2.1\textendash 4.1]; p {$<$} 0.001), and higher tidal volume (mean difference, 0.76\,mL/kg/predicted body weight [95\% CI, 0.5\textendash 1.0]; p {$<$} 0.001). More patients in airway pressure release ventilation had transient severe hypercapnia, defined as an elevation of Pco2 at greater than or equal to 55 along with a pH less than 7.15 (42\% vs 15\%; p = 0.009); other outcomes were similar. Overall mortality was 69\%, with no difference between the groups (78\% in airway pressure release ventilation vs 60\% in low tidal volume; p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, when compared with low tidal volume, airway pressure release ventilation was not associated with more ventilator-free days or improvement in other relevant outcomes in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019.},

We performed a nationwide study to examine whether CSC capabilities influenced in-hospital mortality of patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Of the 1,369 certified training institutions in Japan, 749 hospitals responded to a questionnaire survey regarding CSC capabilities that queried the availability of personnel, diagnostic techniques, specific expertise, infrastructure, and educational components recommended for CSCs. Among the institutions that responded, data on patients hospitalized for stroke between April 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011 were obtained from the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database. In-hospital mortality was analyzed using hierarchical logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, level of consciousness on admission, comorbidities, and the number of fulfilled CSC items in each component and in total. Data from 265 institutions and 53,170 emergency-hospitalized patients were analyzed. Mortality rates were 7.8\% for patients with ischemic stroke, 16.8\% for patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and 28.1\% for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Mortality adjusted for age, sex, and level of consciousness was significantly correlated with personnel, infrastructural, educational, and total CSC scores in patients with ischemic stroke. Mortality was significantly correlated with diagnostic, educational, and total CSC scores in patients with ICH and with specific expertise, infrastructural, educational, and total CSC scores in patients with SAH. CSC capabilities were associated with reduced in-hospital mortality rates, and relevant aspects of care were found to be dependent on stroke type.}

Past definitions have not always been illuminating and a simple method (such as the change-in-estimate method for confounding) has not been available to determine its presence and magnitude in the study sample. A better understanding of the nature of the bias has led to the definition of endogenous selection bias. It is the result of conditioning on a collider variable, itself caused by two other variables; the latter variables become spuriously associated. Conditioning on a variable in the analysis that is a collider or on an indicator of sample selection has the same effect. Note that selection bias is possible even in the absence of a collider, but in the presence of endogenous selection bias, the concern is whether it is possible to identify a causal effect in the sample. Conditions have been outlined to determine that. However, even if conditions are met to identify a causal effect in the study sample, its generalization to a defined target population is not a given.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Current equations for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) that use serum creatinine or cystatin C incorporate age, sex, and race to estimate measured GFR. However, race in eGFR equations is a social and not a biologic construct. METHODS We developed new eGFR equations without race using data from two development data sets: 10 studies (8254 participants, 31.5\% Black) for serum creatinine and 13 studies (5352 participants, 39.7\% Black) for both serum creatinine and cystatin C. In a validation data set of 12 studies (4050 participants, 14.3\% Black), we compared the accuracy of new eGFR equations to measured GFR. We projected the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and GFR stages in a sample of U.S. adults, using current and new equations. RESULTS In the validation data set, the current creatinine equation that uses age, sex, and race overestimated measured GFR in Blacks (median, 3.7 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.8 to 5.4) and to a lesser degree in non-Blacks (median, 0.5 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95\% CI, 0.0 to 0.9). When the adjustment for Black race was omitted from the current eGFR equation, measured GFR in Blacks was underestimated (median, 7.1 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95\% CI, 5.9 to 8.8). A new equation using age and sex and omitting race underestimated measured GFR in Blacks (median, 3.6 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95\% CI, 1.8 to 5.5) and overestimated measured GFR in non-Blacks (median, 3.9 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95\% CI, 3.4 to 4.4). For all equations, 85\% or more of the eGFRs for Blacks and non-Blacks were within 30\% of measured GFR. New creatinine\textendash cystatin C equations without race were more accurate than new creatinine equations, with smaller differences between race groups. As compared with the current creatinine equation, the new creatinine equations, but not the new creatinine\textendash cystatin C equations, increased population estimates of CKD prevalence among Blacks and yielded similar or lower prevalence among non-Blacks.

We aimed to determine the predictors of admission, length of stay, and outcome for ICU among participants of the main Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial (INTERACT2). INTERACT2 was an international, open, blinded endpoint, randomized controlled trial of 2839 ICH patients ({$<$}6 h) and elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) allocated to receive intensive (target SBP {$<$}140 mmHg within 1 h) or guideline-recommended (target SBP {$<$}180 mmHg) BP-lowering treatment. The primary outcome was death or major disability, defined by modified Rankin scale scores 3\textendash 6 at 90 days. Logistic regression and propensity score analyses were used to determine independent associations. Predictors of ICU admission included younger age, recruitment in China, prior ischemic/undetermined stroke, high SBP, severe stroke [National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) score {$\geq$}15], large ICH volume ({$\geq$}15 mL), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) extension, early neurological deterioration, intubation and surgery. Determinants of prolonged ICU stay ({$\geq$}5 days) were prior antihypertensive use, NIHSS {$\geq$}15, large ICH volume, lobar ICH location, IVH, early neurological deterioration, intubation and surgery. ICU admission was associated with higher-risk major disability at 90-day assessment compared to those without ICU admission. This study presents prognostic variables for ICU management and outcome of ICH patients included in a large international cohort. These data may assist in the selection and counseling of patients and families concerning ICU admission.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), an association which may be confounded by unobserved patient and prescriber characteristics. OBJECTIVE: We assessed for confounding in the association between PPI use and CAP by using a `falsification approach,' which estimated whether PPI use is also implausibly associated with other common medical conditions for which no known pathophysiologic link exists. DESIGN: Retrospective claims-based cohort study. SETTING: Six private U.S. health plans. SUBJECTS: Individuals who filled at least one prescription for a PPI (N=26,436) and those who never did (N=28,054) over 11 years. INTERVENTIONS: Multivariate linear regression of the association between a filled prescription for a PPI and a diagnosis of CAP in each 3-month quarter. In falsification analyses, we tested for implausible associations between PPI use in each quarter and rates of osteoarthritis, chest pain, urinary tract infection (UTI), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), skin infection, and rheumatoid arthritis. Independent variables included an indicator for whether a prescription for a PPI was filled in a given quarter, and quarterly indicators for various co-morbidities, age, income, geographic location, and marital status. KEY RESULTS: Compared to nonusers, those ever using a PPI had higher adjusted rates of CAP in quarters in which no prescription was filled (68 vs. 61 cases per 10,000 persons, p{$<$}0.001). Similar associations were noted for all conditions (e.g. chest pain, 336 vs. 282 cases, p{$<$}0.001; UTI, 151 vs. 139 cases, p{$<$}0.001). Among those ever using a PPI, quarters in which a prescription was filled were associated with higher adjusted rates of CAP (111 vs. 68 cases per 10,000, p{$<$}0.001) and all other conditions (e.g. chest pain, 597 vs. 336 cases, p{$<$}0.001; UTI, 186 vs. 151 cases, p{$<$}0.001), compared to quarters in which no prescription was filled. CONCLUSION: PPI use is associated with CAP, but also implausibly associated with common medical conditions.},

  abstract = {Clinical prediction models (CPMs) have become fundamental for risk stratification across healthcare. The CPM pipeline (development, validation, deployment, and impact assessment) is commonly viewed as a one-time activity, with model updating rarely considered and done in a somewhat ad hoc manner. This fails to address the fact that the performance of a CPM worsens over time as natural changes in populations and care pathways occur. CPMs need constant surveillance to maintain adequate predictive performance. Rather than reactively updating a developed CPM once evidence of deteriorated performance accumulates, it is possible to proactively adapt CPMs whenever new data becomes available. Approaches for validation then need to be changed accordingly, making validation a continuous rather than a discrete effort. As such, ``living'' (dynamic) CPMs represent a paradigm shift, where the analytical methods dynamically generate updated versions of a model through time; one then needs to validate the system rather than each subsequent model revision.},

  abstract = {Although the Brain Attack Coalition recommended establishing centers of comprehensive care for stroke and cerebrovascular disease patients, a scoring system for such centers was lacking. We created and validated a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) score, adapted to Japanese circumstances. Of the selected 1369 certified training institutions in Japan, 749 completed an acute stroke care capabilities survey. Hospital performance was determined using a 25-item score, evaluating 5 subcategories: personnel, diagnostic techniques, specific expertise, infrastructure, and education. Consistency and validity were examined using correlation coefficients and factorial analysis. The CSC score (median, 14; interquartile range, 11\textendash 18) varied according to hospital volume. The five subcategories showed moderate consistency (Cronbach's {$\alpha$} = 0.765). A strong correlation existed between types of available personnel and specific expertise. Using the 2011 Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database for patients hospitalized with stroke, four constructs were identified by factorial analysis (neurovascular surgery and intervention, vascular neurology, diagnostic neuroradiology, and neurocritical care and rehabilitation) that affected in-hospital mortality from ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The total CSC score was related to in-hospital mortality from ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR], 0.973; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.958\textendash 0.989), intracerebral hemorrhage (OR, 0.970; 95\% CI, 0.950\textendash 0.990), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (OR, 0.951; 95\% CI, 0.925\textendash 0.977), with varying contributions from the four constructs. The CSC score is a valid measure for assessing CSC capabilities, based on the availability of neurovascular surgery and intervention, vascular neurology, diagnostic neuroradiology, and critical care and rehabilitation services.}

  abstract = {Background: An estimand is a precise description of the treatment effect to be estimated from a trial (the question) and is distinct from the methods of statistical analysis (how the question is to be answered). The potential use of estimands to improve trial research and reporting has been underpinned by the recent publication of the ICH E9(R1) Addendum on the use of estimands in clinical trials in 2019. We set out to assess how well estimands are described in published trial protocols. Methods: We reviewed 50 trial protocols published in October 2020 in Trials and BMJ Open. For each protocol, we determined whether the estimand for the primary outcome was explicitly stated, not stated but inferable (i.e. could be constructed from the information given), or not inferable. Results: None of the 50 trials explicitly described the estimand for the primary outcome, and in 74\% of trials, it was impossible to infer the estimand from the information included in the protocol. The population attribute of the estimand could not be inferred in 36\% of trials, the treatment condition attribute in 20\%, the population-level summary measure in 34\%, and the handling of intercurrent events in 60\% (the strategy for handling non-adherence was not inferable in 32\% of protocols, and the strategy for handling mortality was not inferable in 80\% of the protocols for which it was applicable). Conversely, the outcome attribute was stated for all trials. In 28\% of trials, three or more of the five estimand attributes could not be inferred. Conclusions: The description of estimands in published trial protocols is poor, and in most trials, it is impossible to understand exactly what treatment effect is being estimated. Given the utility of estimands to improve clinical research and reporting, this urgently needs to change.},

  abstract = {Background: Adjustment for prognostic covariates can lead to increased power in the analysis of randomized trials. However, adjusted analyses are not often performed in practice. Methods: We used simulation to examine the impact of covariate adjustment on 12 outcomes from 8 studies across a range of therapeutic areas. We assessed (1) how large an increase in power can be expected in practice; and (2) the impact of adjustment for covariates that are not prognostic. Results: Adjustment for known prognostic covariates led to large increases in power for most outcomes. When power was set to 80\% based on an unadjusted analysis, covariate adjustment led to a median increase in power to 92.6\% across the 12 outcomes (range 80.6 to 99.4\%). Power was increased to over 85\% for 8 of 12 outcomes, and to over 95\% for 5 of 12 outcomes. Conversely, the largest decrease in power from adjustment for covariates that were not prognostic was from 80\% to 78.5\%. Conclusions: Adjustment for known prognostic covariates can lead to substantial increases in power, and should be routinely incorporated into the analysis of randomized trials. The potential benefits of adjusting for a small number of possibly prognostic covariates in trials with moderate or large sample sizes far outweigh the risks of doing so, and so should also be considered.},

  abstract = {Background: Acute myelopathies represent a heterogeneous group of disorders with distinct etiologies, clinical and radiologic features, and prognoses. Transverse myelitis (TM) is a prototype member of this group in which an immune-mediated process causes neural injury to the spinal cord, resulting in varying degrees of weakness, sensory alterations, and autonomic dysfunction. TM may exist as part of a multifocal CNS disease (eg, MS), multisystemic disease (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus), or as an isolated, idiopathic entity. Review Summary: In this article, we summarize recent classification and diagnostic schemes, which provide a framework for the diagnosis and management of patients with acute myelopathy. Additionally, we review the state of current knowledge about the epidemiology, natural history, immunopathogenesis, and treatment strategies for patients with TM. Conclusions: Our understanding of the classification, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment of TM has recently begun to expand dramatically. With more rigorous criteria applied to distinguish acute myelopathies and with an emerging understanding of immunopathogenic events that underlie TM, it may now be possible to effectively initiate treatments in many of these disorders. Through the investigation of TM, we are also gaining a broader appreciation of the mechanisms that lead to autoimmune neurologic diseases in general.},

  abstract = {Background: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been found to be similar or superior to warfarin in reducing ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We sought to examine the anticoagulation prescription patterns in community since the advent of DOACs and also evaluate the outcomes in terms of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, ischemic stroke, and ICH in real-world patients with AF receiving anticoagulation. Methods: This is a retrospective study comprising patients who were newly diagnosed with nonvalvular AF and were prescribed anticoagulants for stroke prevention. Prescription pattern of the anticoagulants based on CHA2DS2Vasc score was studied. Clinical outcomes of GI bleeding, ischemic stroke, and ICH were analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression model. Results: Of the 2362 patients with AF on anticoagulation, 44.7\% were prescribed DOACs. Patients with CHA2DS2VASc score of  3 received a prescription for warfarin more often than DOACs (P {$<$} .001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the incidence of GI bleed (odds ratio [OR]: 0.91, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62-1.35, P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .66) and stroke (OR: 0.77, 95\% CI: 0.57-1.05, P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .10) was similar between warfarin and DOAC users. However, there was a trend toward lower ICH in the DOAC group (OR: 0.60, 95\% CI: 0.36-1.01, P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .06). Conclusions: Prescription rate of DOACs for nonvalvular AF has increased significantly, with apixaban being the most commonly used agent. Patients with higher CHA2DS2-VASc score ( 3) are prescribed DOACs less often than warfarin. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear. Given the favorable risk\textendash benefit profile of DOACs, further studies are needed to identify factors that determine anticoagulant selection in patients with AF with high thromboembolic risk.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To assess whether use of low-chloride solutions in unselected critically ill or perioperative adult patients for maintenance or resuscitation could reduce mortality and use of renal replacement therapy (RRT) when compared to high-chloride fluids. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis with random-effects inverse variance model. PubMed, Cochrane library, EMBASE, LILACS and Web of Science were searched up until October 2016. Eligible studies included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in any language that enrolled critically ill and/or perioperative adult patients and compared a low- to a high-chloride solution for volume maintenance or resuscitation. The primary outcomes were mortality and RRT use. We conducted trial sequential analyses (TSA) and assessed risk of bias of individual trials and the overall quality of evidence. Results: Fifteen trials with 4,067 patients, most at low risk of bias, were identified. Of those, only 11 and 10 trials had data on mortality and RRT use, respectively. In the majority of the studies, there was a low study fluid exposure, in the range of 2-3L. Volumes around 7L (or above) were administered only in 3.2\% (131/4,067) of this meta-analysis\textasciiacute{} population. No statistically significant impact on mortality (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.90; 95\% confidence interval (CI) CI 0.69 \textendash{} 1.17; p = 0.44; I2 = 0\%) or RRT use (OR 1.12; 95\%CI 0.80 \textendash{} 1.58; p = 0.52; I2 = 0\%) was found. Overall quality of evidence was moderate for both primary outcomes . TSA was performed for mortality and use of RRT. Neither the curve for mortality nor for RRT crossed the boundaries of superiority or inferiority. Available data was insufficient to calculate the futility boundary. Optimal sample size was estimated in 9,517 patients for mortality and 22,826 for RRT. Conclusions: The current evidence on low- versus high-chloride solutions for unselected critically ill or perioperative adult patients demonstrates no benefit but suffers from considerable imprecision. Results from well-conducted, adequately-powered RCTs examining sufficiently large fluid exposure are necessary.},

  abstract = {Background: Surrogate outcomes are not intrinsically beneficial to patients, but are designed to be easier and faster to measure than clinically meaningful outcomes. The use of surrogates as an endpoint in clinical trials and basis for regulatory approval is common, and frequently exceeds the guidance given by regulatory bodies. Discussion: In this article, we demonstrate that the use of surrogates in oncology is widespread and increasing. At the same time, the strength of association between the surrogates used and clinically meaningful outcomes is often unknown or weak. Attempts to validate surrogates are rarely undertaken. When this is done, validation relies on only a fraction of available data, and often concludes that the surrogate is poor. Post-marketing studies, designed to ensure drugs have meaningful benefits, are often not performed. Alternatively, if a drug fails to improve quality of life or overall survival, market authorization is rarely revoked. We suggest this reliance on surrogates, and the imprecision surrounding their acceptable use, means that numerous drugs are now approved based on small yet statistically significant increases in surrogates of questionable reliability. In turn, this means the benefits of many approved drugs are uncertain. This is an unacceptable situation for patients and professionals, as prior experience has shown that such uncertainty can be associated with significant harm. Conclusion: The use of surrogate outcomes should be limited to situations where a surrogate has demonstrated robust ability to predict meaningful benefits, or where cases are dire, rare or with few treatment options. In both cases, surrogates must be used only when continuing studies examining hard endpoints have been fully recruited.},

Design: Pooled, cross-sectional design using data from 1998 to 2010 from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) with linked Medicare claims data. Setting: NA. Participants: Stroke survivors who were Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries and participated in the HRS were included (NZ515). Main Outcome Measure: Utilization of rehabilitation services up to 10 years poststroke was the primary outcome with logistic regression used to predict utilization. Covariates included demographic factors, baseline functional status, health conditions, personal lifestyle factors, and social support. Results: Rehabilitation service utilization was 21.6\%, 6.8\%, 15.8\%, 16.5\%, and {$<$}16\% in years 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, respectively. Age was the primary factor predicting use of rehabilitation in the first 10 years poststroke (odds ratio: 1.14; PZ.001). Recurrent stroke (odds ratio: 1.64; PZ.051) was also significantly associated with utilization, whereas unspecified incident stroke at incident trended toward significance (odds ratio: 2.17; PZ.077). None of the other factors was a significant predictor of participation in rehabilitation services in this period. Conclusion: A small number of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who are stroke survivors utilize rehabilitation services in the first 10 years poststroke. Of those who do, age is the primary driver of utilization. We analyzed a multitude of factors that might influence utilization, but other factors not available in these data also need to be explored.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To use the concept of reverse fragility index (RFI) to provide a measure of confidence in the neutrality of RCT results when assessed from the clinical perspective. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional study, a MEDLINE search was conducted for RCTs published from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2018, in JAMA, the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), and The Lancet. Eligible studies were phase 3 and 4 trials with 1:1 randomization and statistically nonsignificant binary primary end points. Data analysis was performed from August 1, 2019, to August 31, 2019. EXPOSURES Single vs multicenter enrollment, total number of events, private vs government funding, placebo vs active control, and time to event vs frequency data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the median RFI with interquartile range (IQR) at the P = .05 threshold. Secondary outcomes were the number of RCTs in which the number of participants lost to follow-up was greater than the RFI; the median RFI with IQR at different P value thresholds; the median reverse fragility quotient with IQR; and the correlation between sample sizes, number of events, and P values of the RCT and RFI. RESULTS Of the 167 RCTs included, 76 (46\%) were published in the NEJM, 50 (30\%) in JAMA, and 41 (24\%) in The Lancet. The median (IQR) sample size was 970 (470-3427) participants, and the median (IQR) number of events was 251 (105-570). The median (IQR) RFI at the P = .05 threshold was 8 (5-13). Fifty-seven RCTs (34\%) had an RFI of 5 or lower, and in 68 RCTs (41\%) the number of participants lost to follow-up was greater than the RFI. Trials with P values ranging from P = .06 to P = .10 had a median (IQR) RFI of 3 (2-4). When compared, median (IQR) RFIs were not statistically significant for single-center vs multicenter enrollment (5 [4-13] vs 8 [5-13]; P = .41), private vs government-funded studies (9 [5-13] vs 8 [5-13]; P = .34), and time-to-event primary end points vs frequency data (9 [5-14] vs 7 [4-13]; P = .43). The median (IQR) RFI at the P = .01 threshold was 12 (7-19) and at the P = .005 threshold was 14 (9-21). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This cross-sectional study found that a relatively small number of events (median of 8) had to change to move the primary end point of an RCT from nonsignificant to statistically significant. These findings emphasize the nuance required when interpreting trial results that did not meet prespecified significance thresholds.},

Activities associated with knowledge production and use are called epistemic practices. Such practices are considered in biomedical and clinical literatures, social sciences of medicine, philosophy of science and philosophy of medicine, and also in other nonmedical literatures. A host of different kinds of knowledge claims have been identified, each with different uses and logics of justification. A general framework is needed to situate these diverse contributions in medical epistemology, so we can see how they fit together. But developing such a framework turns out to be quite tricky. In this survey, three possible frameworks are considered along with the difficulties associated with each of them. The essay concludes with a fourth framework, which considers any epistemology as part of a practice that is oriented toward overcoming errors that emerge in antecedently given practices where knowledge is developed and used. As medicine indirectly advances health by directly mitigating disease, so epistemology indirectly advances knowledge by directly mitigating error.},

This study evaluated factors associated with admission to intensive care unit (ICU) level of care. This is an observational study of all adult patients admitted to our institution with non-traumatic supratentorial ICH presenting within 72 h of symptom onset between 2009\textendash 2012 (derivation cohort) and 2005\textendash 2008 (validation cohort). Factors associated with neuroscience ICU admission were identified via logistic regression analysis, from which a triage model was derived, refined, and retrospectively validated. For the derivation cohort, 229 patients were included, of whom 70 patients (31 \%) required ICU care. Predictors of neuroscience ICU admission were: younger age [odds ratio (OR) 0.94, 95 \% CI 0.91\textendash 0.97; p = 0.0004], lower Full Outline of UnResponsiveness (FOUR) score (0.39, 0.28\textendash 0.54; p {$<$} 0.0001) or Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (0.55, 0.45\textendash 0.67; p {$<$} 0.0001), and larger ICH volume (1.04, 1.03\textendash 1.06; p {$<$} 0.0001). The model was further refined with clinician input and the addition of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). GCS was chosen for the model rather than the FOUR score as it is more widely used. The proposed triage ICH model utilizes three variables: ICH volume {$\geq$}30 cc, GCS score {$<$}13, and IVH. The triage ICH model predicted the need for ICU admission with a sensitivity of 94.3 \% in the derivation cohort [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.88; p {$<$} 0.001] and 97.8 \% (AUC = 0.88) in the validation cohort. Presented are the derivation, refinement, and validation of the triage ICH model. This model requires prospective validation, but may be a useful tool to aid clinicians in determining the appropriate level of care at the time of initial presentation for a patient with a supratentorial ICH.},

We used Bayesian statistics to evaluate any heterogeneity in the effect of oxygenation targets on mortality between different patient groups within the HOT-ICU trial. Methods: We analysed 90-day all-cause mortality using adjusted Bayesian logistic regression models, and assessed heterogeneous treatment effects according to four selected baseline variables using both hierarchical models of subgroups and models with interactions on the continuous scales. Results are presented as mortality probability (\%) and relative risk (RR) with 95\% credibility intervals (CrI). Results: All 2888 patients in the intention-to-treat cohort of the HOT-ICU trial were included. The adjusted 90-day mortality rates were 43.0\% (CrI: 38.3e47.8\%) and 42.3\% (CrI: 37.7e47.1\%) in the lower and higher oxygenation groups, respectively (RR 1.02 [CrI: 0.93e1.11]), with 36.5\% probability of an RR {$<$}1.00. Analyses of heterogeneous treatment effects suggested a doseeresponse relationship between baseline norepinephrine dose and increased mortality with the lower oxygenation target, with 95\% probability of increased mortality associated with the lower oxygenation target as norepinephrine doses increased. Conclusions: A lower oxygenation target was unlikely to affect overall mortality amongst critically ill adult patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure. However, our results suggest an increasing mortality risk for patients with a lower oxygen target as the baseline norepinephrine dose increases. These findings warrant additional investigation.},

  abstract = {Current guidelines for management of critically ill stroke patients suggest that treatment in a neurocritical care unit (NCCU) and/or by a neurointensivist (NI) may be beneficial, but the contribution of each to outcome is unknown. The relative impact of a NCCU versus NI on short- and long-term outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was assessed. 2,096 stroke patients admitted to a NCCU or nonneuro ICU at a tertiary stroke center were analyzed before the appointment of a NI, during the NI's tenure, and after the NI departed and was not replaced. Data included admission ICU type, availability of a NI, age, NIHSS, ICH score, and 3 and 12 month outcome. For AIS, compared to the time interval with a NI, departure of the NI predicted a worse rate of return to pre-stroke function at 3 months. For ICH, NCCU treatment predicted shorter ICU and hospital LOS but had no effect on short- or long-term outcomes. No effect of a NI was seen. For SAH, availability of an NI (but not an NCCU) predicted improved outcomes but longer ICU LOS. Disposition and in-hospital mortality improved when a NI was present, but continued improvement did not occur after the NI's departure. Presence of an NI was associated with improved clinical outcomes. This effect was more evident in patients with SAH. Patients with ICH tend to have poor outcomes regardless of the presence of a NCCU or a NI.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dural arteriovenous fistulae can present with hemorrhage, but there remains a paucity of data regarding subsequent outcomes. We sought to use the CONDOR (Consortium for Dural Arteriovenous Fistula Outcomes Research), a multi-institutional registry, to characterize the morbidity and mortality of dural arteriovenous fistula\textendash related hemorrhage. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients in CONDOR who presented with dural arteriovenous fistula\textendash related hemorrhage was performed. Patient characteristics, clinical follow-up, and radiographic details were analyzed for associations with poor outcome (defined as modified Rankin Scale score {$\geq$}3). RESULTS: The CONDOR dataset yielded 262 patients with incident hemorrhage, with median follow-up of 1.4 years. Poor outcome was observed in 17.0\% (95\% CI, 12.3\%\textendash 21.7\%) at follow-up, including a 3.6\% (95\% CI, 1.3\%\textendash 6.0\%) mortality. Age and anticoagulant use were associated with poor outcome on multivariable analysis (odds ratio, 1.04, odds ratio, 5.1 respectively). Subtype of hemorrhage and venous shunting pattern of the lesion did not affect outcome significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Within the CONDOR registry, dural arteriovenous fistula\textendash related hemorrhage was associated with a relatively lower morbidity and mortality than published outcomes from other arterialized cerebrovascular lesions but still at clinically consequential rates.},

However, POCUS training and scope of practice remain relatively undefined in nephrology. The utility of diagnostic POCUS beyond kidney and vascular access is under-recognized. Assessment of fluid status is a frequent dilemma faced by nephrologists in day-to-day practice where multi-organ POCUS can enhance the sensitivity of conventional physical examination. POCUS also reduces fragmentation of care, facilitates timely diagnosis, and expedites management. While the need for further imaging studies is obviated in selected cases, POCUS is not meant to serve as an alternative to consultative imaging. In addition, utility of POCUS depends on the skills and experience of the operator, which in turn depends on the quality of training. In this review, we discuss the rationale behind nephrologists performing POCUS, discuss case examples to illustrate the basic principles of focused ultrasonography, and share our experience-based opinion about developing a POCUS training program at the institutional level.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subcortical injury resulting from conventional surgical management of intracranial hemorrhage may counteract the potential benefits of hematoma evacuation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and potential benefits of a novel, minimally invasive approach for clot evacuation in a multicenter study. METHODS: The integrated approach incorporates 5 competencies: (1) image interpretation and trajectory planning, (2) dynamic navigation, (3) atraumatic access system (BrainPath, NICO Corp, Indianapolis, Indiana), (4) extracorporeal optics, and (5) automated atraumatic resection. Twelve neurosurgeons from 11 centers were trained to use this approach through a continuing medical education-accredited course. Demographical, clinical, and radiological data of patients treated over 2~years were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Thirty-nine consecutive patients were identified. The median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at presentation was 10 (range, 5-15). The thalamus/basal ganglion regions were involved in 46\% of the cases. The median hematoma volume and depth were 36~mL (interquartile range [IQR], 27-65~mL) and 1.4~cm (IQR, 0.3-2.9~cm), respectively. The median time from ictus to surgery was 24.5~hours (IQR, 16-66~hours). The degree of hematoma evacuation was {$\geq$}90\%, 75\% to 89\%, and 50\% to 74\% in 72\%, 23\%, and 5.0\% of the patients, respectively. The median GCS score at discharge was 14 (range, 8-15). The improvement in GCS score was statistically significant ( P {$<$} .001). Modified Rankin Scale data were available for 35 patients. Fifty-two percent of those patients had a modified Rankin Scale score of {$\leq$}2. There were no mortalities. CONCLUSION: The approach was safely performed in all patients with a relatively high rate of clot evacuation and functional independence.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is unknown when to start anticoagulation after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) from atrial fibrillation (AF). Early anticoagulation may prevent recurrent infarctions but may provoke hemorrhagic transformation as AF strokes are typically larger and hemorrhagic transformation-prone. Later anticoagulation may prevent hemorrhagic transformation but increases risk of secondary stroke in this time frame. Our aim was to compare early anticoagulation with apixaban in AF patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) versus warfarin administration at later intervals. METHODS: AREST (Apixaban for Early Prevention of Recurrent Embolic Stroke and Hemorrhagic Transformation) was an open-label, randomized controlled trial comparing the safety of early use of apixaban at day 0 to 3 for TIA, day 3 to 5 for small-sized AIS ({$<$}1.5 cm), and day 7 to 9 for medium-sized AIS ({$\geq$}1.5 cm, excluding full cortical territory), to warfarin, in a 1:1 ratio at 1 week post-TIA, or 2 weeks post-AIS. RESULTS: Although AREST ended prematurely after a national guideline focused update recommended direct oral anticoagulants over warfarin for AF, it revealed that apixaban had statistically similar yet generally numerically lower rates of recurrent strokes/TIA (14.6\% versus 19.2\%, P=0.78), death (4.9\% versus 8.5\%, P=0.68), fatal strokes (2.4\% versus 8.5\%, P=0.37), symptomatic hemorrhages (0\% versus 2.1\%), and the primary composite outcome of fatal stroke, recurrent ischemic stroke, or TIA (17.1\% versus 25.5\%, P=0.44). One symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurred on warfarin, none on apixaban. Five asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformation occurred in each arm. CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of anticoagulation after TIA, small-, or medium-sized AIS from AF does not appear to compromise patient safety. Potential efficacy of early initiation of anticoagulation remains to be determined from larger pivotal trials.},

  abstract = {Investigation into the association of insurance status with the outcomes of patients undergoing neurosurgical intervention has been limited: this is the first nationwide study to analyze the impact of primary payer on the outcomes of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage who underwent endovascular coiling or microsurgical clipping. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2001\textendash 2010) was utilized to identify patients; those with both an ICD-9 diagnosis codes for subarachnoid hemorrhage and a procedure code for aneurysm repair (either via an endovascular or surgical approach) were included. Hierarchical multivariate regression analyses were utilized to evaluate the impact of primary payer on in-hospital mortality, hospital discharge disposition, and length of hospital stay with hospital as the random effects variable. Models were adjusted for patient age, sex, race, comorbidities, socioeconomic status, hospital region, location (urban versus rural), and teaching status, procedural volume, year of admission, and the proportion of patients who underwent ventriculostomy. Subsequent models were also adjusted for time to aneurysm repair and time to ventriculostomy; subgroup analyses evaluated for those who underwent endovascular and surgical procedures separately. 15,557 hospitalizations were included. In the initial model, the adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality were higher for Medicare (OR 1.23, p,0.001), Medicaid (OR 1.23, p,0.001), and uninsured patients (OR 1.49, p,0.001) compared to those with private insurance. After also adjusting for timing of intervention, Medicaid and uninsured patients had a reduced odds of non-routine discharge (OR 0.75, p,0.001 and OR 0.42, p,0.001) despite longer hospital stays (by 8.35 days, p,0.001 and 2.45 days, p = 0.005). Variations in outcomes by primary payer\textendash including in-hospital post-procedural mortality\textendash were more pronounced for patients of all insurance types who underwent microsurgical clipping. The observed differences by primary payer are likely multifactorial, attributable to varied socioeconomic factors and the complexities of the American healthcare delivery system.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Intravenous (IV) milrinone, in combination with induced hypertension, has been proposed as a treat-ment option for cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). However, data on its safety and efficacy are scarce. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} This was a controlled observational study conducted in an academic hospital with prospectively and retrospectively collected data. Consecutive patients with cerebral vasospasm following aSAH and treated with both IV milrinone (0.5 \textmu g/kg/min-1, as part of a strict protocol) and induced hypertension were compared with a historical control group receiving hypertension alone. Multivariable analyses aimed at minimizing potential biases. We assessed (1) 6-month functional disability (defined as a score between 2 and 6 on the modified Rankin Scale) and vasospasmrelated brain infarction, (2) the rate of first-line or rescue endovascular angioplasty for vasospasm, and (3) immediate tolerance to IV milrinone. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Ninety-four patients were included (41 and 53 in the IV milrinone and the control group, respectively). IV milrinone infusion was independently associated with a lower likelihood of 6-month functional disability (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]\,=\,0.28, 95\% confidence interval [CI]\,=\,0.10\textendash 0.77]) and vasospasm-related brain infarction (aOR\,=\,0.19, 95\% CI 0.04\textendash 0.94). Endovascular angioplasty was less frequent in the IV milrinone group (6 [15\%] vs. 28 [53\%] patients, p\,=\,0.0001, aOR\,=\,0.12, 95\% CI 0.04\textendash 0.38). IV milrinone (median duration of infusion, 5 [2\textendash 8] days) was prematurely discontinued owing to poor tolerance in 12 patients, mostly (n\,=\,10) for ``non/hardly-attained induced hypertension'' (mean arterial blood pressure\,{$<$}\,100 mmHg despite 1.5 \textmu g/kg/min-1 of norepinephrine). However, this event was simi-larly observed in IV milrinone and control patients (n\,=\,10 [24\%] vs. n\,=\,11 [21\%], respectively, p\,=\,0.68). IV milrinone was associated with a higher incidence of polyuria (IV milrinone patients had creatinine clearance of 191 [153\textendash 238] ml/min-1) and hyponatremia or hypokalemia, whereas arrhythmia, myocardial ischemia, and thrombocytopenia were infrequent. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Despite its premature discontinuation in 29\% of patients as a result of its poor tolerance, IV milrinone was associated with a lower rate of endovascular angioplasty and a positive impact on long-term neurological and radiological outcomes. These preliminary findings encourage the conduction of confirmatory randomized trials.},

Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We retrospectively reviewed patients who had non-inclusion criteria for the HYPERION trial comparing 33 \textdegree C to 37 \textdegree C in patients comatose after cardiac arrest in non-shockable rhythm, due to any cause. A good neurologi-cal outcome was defined as a day-90 Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 or 2. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Of the 1144 patients with non-inclusion criteria, 1130 had day-90 information and, among these, 158 (14\%) had good functional outcomes, compared to 7.9\% overall in the HYPERION trial (10.2\% with and 5.7\% without hypothermia). Considerable centre-to-centre variability was found in the proportion of non-included patients who received hypothermia (0\% to 83.8\%) and who had good day-90 functional outcomes (0\% to 31.3\%). The proportion of patients with a good day-90 functional outcome was significantly higher with than without hypothermia (18.5\% vs. 11.9\%, P\,=\,0.003). Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} Our finding of better functional outcomes without than with inclusion in the HYPERION trial, despite most non-inclusion criteria being of adverse prognostic significance (e.g., long no-flow and low-flow times and haemodynamic instability), raises important questions about the choice of patient selection criteria and the applica-bility of trial results to everyday practice. At present, reserving hypothermia for patients without predictors of poor prognosis seems open to criticism.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Younger children in a school grade cohort may be more likely to receive a diagnosis of attention deficit\textendash hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) than their older peers because of age-based variation in behavior that may be attributed to ADHD rather than to the younger age of the children. Most U.S. states have arbitrary age cutoffs for entry into public school. Therefore, within the same grade, children with birthdays close to the cutoff date can differ in age by nearly 1 year. METHODS We used data from 2007 through 2015 from a large insurance database to compare the rate of ADHD diagnosis among children born in August with that among children born in September in states with and states without the requirement that children be 5 years old by September 1 for enrollment in kindergarten. ADHD diagnosis was determined on the basis of diagnosis codes from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision. We also used prescription records to compare ADHD treatment between children born in August and children born in September in states with and states without the cutoff date of September 1. RESULTS The study population included 407,846 children in all U.S. states who were born in the period from 2007 through 2009 and were followed through December 2015. The rate of claims-based ADHD diagnosis among children in states with a September 1 cutoff was 85.1 per 10,000 children (309 cases among 36,319 children; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 75.6 to 94.2) among those born in August and 63.6 per 10,000 children (225 cases among 35,353 children; 95\% CI, 55.4 to 71.9) among those born in September, an absolute difference of 21.5 per 10,000 children (95\% CI, 8.8 to 34.0); the corresponding difference in states without the September 1 cutoff was 8.9 per 10,000 children (95\% CI, -14.9 to 20.8). The rate of ADHD treatment was 52.9 per 10,000 children (192 of 36,319 children; 95\% CI, 45.4 to 60.3) among those born in August and 40.4 per 10,000 children (143 of 35,353 children; 95\% CI, 33.8 to 47.1) among those born in September, an absolute difference of 12.5 per 10,000 children (95\% CI, 2.43 to 22.4). These differences were not observed for other month-to-month comparisons, nor were they observed in states with non-September cutoff dates for starting kindergarten. In addition, in states with a September 1 cutoff, no significant differences between August-born and September-born children were observed in rates of asthma, diabetes, or obesity. CONCLUSIONS Rates of diagnosis and treatment of ADHD are higher among children born in August than among children born in September in states with a September 1 cutoff for kindergarten entry.

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash Clinical trials in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) have used volume cutoffs as inclusion criteria to select populations in which the effects of interventions are likely to be the greatest. However, optimal volume cutoffs for predicting poor outcome in deep locations (thalamus versus basal ganglia) are unknown. Methods\textemdash We conducted a 2-phase study to determine ICH volume cutoffs for poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of 4\textendash 6) in the thalamus and basal ganglia. Cutoffs with optimal sensitivity and specificity for poor outcome were identified in the ERICH ([Ethnic/Racial Variations of ICH] study; derivation cohort) using receiver operating characteristic curves. The cutoffs were then validated in the ATACH-2 trial (Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage-2) by comparing the c-statistic of regression models for outcome (including dichotomized volume) in the validation cohort. Results\textemdash Of the 3000 patients enrolled in ERICH, 1564 (52\%) had deep ICH, of whom 1305 (84\%) had complete neuroimaging and outcome data (660 thalamic and 645 basal ganglia hemorrhages). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified 8 mL in thalamic (area under the curve, 0.79; sensitivity, 73\%; specificity, 78\%) and 18 mL in basal ganglia ICH (area under the curve, 0.79; sensitivity, 70\%; specificity, 83\%) as optimal cutoffs for predicting poor outcome. The validation cohort included 834 (84\%) patients with deep ICH and complete neuroimaging data enrolled in ATACH-2 (353 thalamic and 431 basal ganglia hemorrhages). In thalamic ICH, the c-statistic of the multivariable outcome model including dichotomized ICH volume was 0.80 (95\% CI, 0.75\textendash 0.85) in the validation cohort. For basal ganglia ICH, the c-statistic was 0.81 (95\% CI, 0.76\textendash 0.85) in the validation cohort. Conclusions\textemdash Optimal hematoma volume cutoffs for predicting poor outcome in deep ICH vary by the specific deep brain nucleus involved. Utilization of location-specific volume cutoffs may improve clinical trial design by targeting deep ICH patients that will obtain maximal benefit from candidate therapies.\hspace{0.6em}\,{$\mkern1mu$}(Stroke. 2019;50:2044-2049.

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of the Korean Hypothermia Network Pro registry. SETTING: Multicenter ICU. PATIENTS: Adult ({$\geq$} 18 yr) comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors who underwent targeted temperature management at 33\textendash 36\textdegree C between October 2015 and December 2018. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We measured the time from the end of rewarming to awakening, defined as a total Glasgow Coma Scale score greater than or equal to 9 or Glasgow Coma Scale motor score equals to 6. The primary outcome was awakening time. The secondary outcome was 6-month neurologic outcomes (poor outcome: Cerebral Performance Category 3\textendash 5). Among 1,145 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors, 477 patients (41.7\%) regained consciousness 30 hours (6\textendash 71\,hr) later, and 116 patients (24.3\%) awakened late (72\,hr after the end of rewarming). Young age, witnessed arrest, shockable rhythm, cardiac etiology, shorter time to return of spontaneous circulation, lower serum lactate level, absence of seizures, and multisedative requirement were associated with awakening. Of the 477 who woke up, 74 (15.5\%) had poor neurologic outcomes. Older age, liver cirrhosis, nonshockable rhythm, noncardiac etiology, a higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and higher serum lactate levels were associated with poor neurologic outcomes. Late awakeners were more common in the poor than in the good neurologic outcome group (38/74 [51.4\%] vs 78/403 [19.4\%]; p {$<$} 0.001). The awakening time (odds ratio, 1.005; 95\% CIs, 1.003\textendash 1.008) and late awakening (odds ratio, 3.194; 95\% CIs, 1.776\textendash 5.746) were independently associated with poor neurologic outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Late awakening after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was common in no withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy settings and the probability of awakening decreased over time.},

Methods: Retrospective cohort, analyzing a large public database\textemdash Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care-III. Adult patients with at least 48 h of mechanical ventilation (MV), under volume controlled ventilation and an oxygenation index less than 300 mmHg were included. Results: A total of 1,142 patients had complete data and were included in the final analyses. According to a causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) that included respiratory system compliance (Crs), tidal volume (Vt), driving pressure ({$\Delta$}P), plateau pressure (PPlat), PEEP, PaO2 and PaCO2 as possible exposures related to severe AKI, only Crs and PEEP levels had significant causal association with severe acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR 0.90, 95\% CI: 0.84\textendash 0.94 for each 5-mL/cmH2O reduction in Crs; OR, 1.05 95\% CI: 1.03\textendash 1.10 for each 1-cmH2O increase of PEEP). Using mediation analysis, we examined whether any mechanical ventilation, blood gas or hemodynamic parameters could explain the effects of Csr on AKI. Only PEEP mediated the significant but small effect (less than 5\%) of Csr on severe AKI. The effects of PEEP, in turn, were not mediated by any other evaluated parameter. Several sensitivity analyses with (I) need of renal replacement therapy (RRT) as an alternative outcome and (II) only patients with Vt {$<$}8 mL/kg, confirmed our main findings. In trying to validate our DAG assumptions, we confirmed that only {$\Delta$}P was associated with mortality but not with severe AKI. Conclusions: Crs and PEEP are the only respiratory-related variables with a direct causal association in severe AKI. No mechanical ventilator or blood gas parameter mediated the effects of Crs. Approaches reducing Vt and/or {$\Delta$}P in ARDS can have limited effect on renal protection.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether moderate hypothermia (31 \textdegree C), compared with mild hypothermia (34 \textdegree C), improves clinical outcomes in comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Single-center, double-blind, randomized, clinical superiority trial carried out in a tertiary cardiac care center in eastern Ontario, Canada. A total of 389 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were enrolled between August 4, 2013, and March 20, 2020, with final follow-up on October 15, 2020. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to temperature management with a target body temperature of 31 \textdegree C (n = 193) or 34 \textdegree C (n = 196) for a period of 24 hours. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was all-cause mortality or poor neurologic outcome at 180 days. Neurologic outcome was assessed using the Disability Rating Scale, with poor neurologic outcome defined as a score greater than 5 (range, 0-29, with 29 being the worst outcome [vegetative state]). There were 19 secondary outcomes, including mortality at 180 days and length of stay in the intensive care unit. RESULTS Among 367 patients included in the primary analysis (mean age, 61 years; 69 women [19\%]), 366 (99.7\%) completed the trial. The primary outcome occurred in 89 of 184 patients (48.4\%) in the 31 \textdegree C group and in 83 of 183 patients (45.4\%) in the 34 \textdegree C group (risk difference, 3.0\% [95\% CI, 7.2\%-13.2\%]; relative risk, 1.07 [95\% CI, 0.86-1.33]; P = .56). Of the 19 secondary outcomes, 18 were not statistically significant. Mortality at 180 days was 43.5\% and 41.0\% in patients treated with a target temperature of 31 \textdegree C and 34 \textdegree C, respectively (P = .63). The median length of stay in the intensive care unit was longer in the 31 \textdegree C group (10 vs 7 days; P = .004). Among adverse events in the 31 \textdegree C group vs the 34 \textdegree C group, deep vein thrombosis occurred in 11.4\% vs 10.9\% and thrombus in the inferior vena cava occurred in 3.8\% and 7.7\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, a target temperature of 31 \textdegree C did not significantly reduce the rate of death or poor neurologic outcome at 180 days compared with a target temperature of 34 \textdegree C. However, the study may have been underpowered to detect a clinically important difference.},

The goal of this article was to provide a roadmap and call attention to key factors that adult critical care medicine leadership in both academic and nonacademic setting should consider when planning for value-based care. Design: Relevant medical literature was accessed through a literature search. Material published by federal health agencies and other specialty organizations was also reviewed. Collaboratively and iteratively, taskforce members corresponded by electronic mail and held monthly conference calls to finalize this report. Setting: The business and value\&sol;performance critical care organization building section comprised of leaders of critical care organizations with expertise in critical care administration, healthcare management, and clinical practice. Measurements and Main Results: Two phases of critical care organizations care integration are described: ``horizontal,'' within the system and regionalization of care as an initial phase, and ``vertical,'' with a post-ICU and postacute care continuum as a succeeding phase. The tools required for the clinical and financial transformation are provided, including the essential prerequisites of forming a critical care organization; the manner in which a critical care organization can help manage transformational domains is considered. Lastly, how to achieve organizational health system support for critical care organization implementation is discussed. Conclusions: A critical care organization that incorporates functional clinical horizontal and vertical integration for ICU patients and survivors, aligns strategy and operations with those of the parent health system, and encompasses knowledge on finance and risk will be better positioned to succeed in the value-based world.}

We present novel evidence that analyzing ordinal data as if they were metric can systematically lead to errors. We demonstrate false alarms (i.e., detecting an effect where none exists, Type I errors) and failures to detect effects (i.e., loss of power, Type II errors). We demonstrate systematic inversions of effects, for which treating ordinal data as metric indicates the opposite ordering of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same problems \textemdash{} false alarms, misses, and inversions \textemdash{} for interactions in factorial designs and for trend analyses in regression. We demonstrate that averaging across multiple ordinal measurements does not solve or even ameliorate these problems. A central contribution is a graphical explanation of how and when the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that there is no sure-fire way to detect these problems by treating the ordinal values as metric, and instead we advocate use of ordered-probit models (or similar) because they will better describe the data. Finally, although frequentist approaches to some ordered-probit models are available, we use Bayesian methods because of their flexibility in specifying models and their richness and accuracy in providing parameter estimates. An R script is provided for running an analysis that compares ordered-probit and metric models.},

Many techniques have been developed for study design and analysis to identify and eliminate such errors. Such problems are not expected to compromise experimental studies, where careful standardization of conditions (for laboratory work) and randomization (for population studies) should, if applied properly, eliminate most such noncausal associations. We argue, however, that a routine precaution taken in the design of biologic laboratory experiments\textemdash the use of ``negative controls''\textemdash is designed to detect both suspected and unsuspected sources of spurious causal inference. In epidemiology, analogous negative controls help to identify and resolve confounding as well as other sources of error, including recall bias or analytic flaws. We distinguish 2 types of negative controls (exposure controls and outcome controls), describe examples of each type from the epidemiologic literature, and identify the conditions for the use of such negative controls to detect confounding. We conclude that negative controls should be more commonly employed in observational studies, and that additional work is needed to specify the conditions under which negative controls will be sensitive detectors of other sources of error in observational studies.},

Data sources~Medline, PreMedline, Embase, and The Cochrane Library.Eligibility criteria for selecting studies~Published randomised trials evaluating the use of a DOAC, vitamin K antagonist, or antiplatelet drug for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation.Results~23 randomised trials involving 94\,656 patients were analysed: 13 compared a DOAC with warfarin dosed to achieve a target INR of 2.0-3.0. Apixaban 5 mg twice daily (odds ratio 0.79, 95\% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.94), dabigatran 150 mg twice daily (0.65, 0.52 to 0.81), edoxaban 60 mg once daily (0.86, 0.74 to 1.01), and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (0.88, 0.74 to 1.03) reduced the risk of stroke or systemic embolism compared with warfarin. The risk of stroke or systemic embolism was higher with edoxaban 60 mg once daily (1.33, 1.02 to 1.75) and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (1.35, 1.03 to 1.78) than with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily. The risk of all-cause mortality was lower with all DOACs than with warfarin. Apixaban 5 mg twice daily (0.71, 0.61 to 0.81), dabigatran 110 mg twice daily (0.80, 0.69 to 0.93), edoxaban 30 mg once daily (0.46, 0.40 to 0.54), and edoxaban 60 mg once daily (0.78, 0.69 to 0.90) reduced the risk of major bleeding compared with warfarin. The risk of major bleeding was higher with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily than apixaban 5 mg twice daily (1.33, 1.09 to 1.62), rivaroxaban 20 mg twice daily than apixaban 5 mg twice daily (1.45, 1.19 to 1.78), and rivaroxaban 20 mg twice daily than edoxaban 60 mg once daily (1.31, 1.07 to 1.59). The risk of intracranial bleeding was substantially lower for most DOACs compared with warfarin, whereas the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was higher with some DOACs than warfarin. Apixaban 5 mg twice daily was ranked the highest for most outcomes, and was cost effective compared with warfarin.Conclusions~The network meta-analysis informs the choice of DOACs for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Several DOACs are of net benefit compared with warfarin. A trial directly comparing DOACs would overcome the need for indirect comparisons to be made through network meta-analysis.Systematic review registration~PROSPERO CRD 42013005324.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Tracheostomy represents one important and value-laden treatment decision after severe acute brain injury (SABI). Whether to pursue this life-sustaining treatment typically hinges on intense conversations between family and clinicians. The aim of this study was, among a cohort of patient who had undergone tracheostomy after SABI, to explore the long-term reflections of patients and their families as they look back on this decision. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} For this qualitative study, we reviewed the electronic medical records of patients with SABI who underwent tracheostomy. We included all patients who were admitted to our 30-bed neuro-intensive care unit with SABI and underwent tracheostomy between November 2017 and October 2019. Using purposive sampling, we invited survivors and family members to participate in telephone interviews greater than 3 months after SABI until thematic saturation was reached. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed by using thematic analysis. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Overall, 38 patients with SABI in the neuro-intensive care unit underwent tracheostomy. The mean age of patients was 49 (range 18\textendash 81), with 19 of 38 patients diagnosed with traumatic brain injury and 19 of 38 with stroke. We interviewed 20 family members of 18 of 38 patients at a mean of 16 (SD 9) months after hospitalization. The mean patient age among those with an interview was 50 (range 18\textendash 76); the mean modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) was 4.7 (SD 0.8) at hospital discharge. At the time of the interview, ten patients lived at home and two in a skilled nursing facility and had a mean mRS of 2.6 (SD 0.9), and six had died. As families reflected on the decision to proceed with a tracheostomy, two themes emerged. First, families did not remember tracheostomy as a choice because the uncertain chance of recovery rendered the certain alternative of death unacceptable or because they valued survival above all and therefore could not perceive an alternative to life-sustaining treatment. Second, families identified a fundamental need to receive supportive, consistent communication centering around compassion, clarity, and hope. When this need was met, families were able to reflect on the tracheostomy decision with peace, regardless of their loved one's eventual outcome. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} After SABI, prognostic uncertainty almost transcends the concept of choice. Families who proceeded with a tracheostomy saw it as the only option at the time. High-quality communication may mitigate the stress surrounding this high-stakes decision.},

The purpose of this predefined secondary analysis was to identify if any effects of fluoxetine were maintained or delayed over 12 months. METHODS: EFFECTS was an investigator-led, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial in Sweden that enrolled adult patients with stroke. Patients were randomized to 20 mg oral fluoxetine or matching placebo for 6 months and followed for another 6 months. The primary outcome was functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale), at 6 months. Predefined secondary outcomes for these analyses included the modified Rankin Scale, health status, quality of life, fatigue, mood, and depression at 12 months. RESULTS: One thousand five hundred patients were recruited from 35 centers in Sweden between 2014 and 2019; 750 were allocated fluoxetine and 750 placebo. At 12 months, modified Rankin Scale data were available in 715 (95\%) patients allocated fluoxetine and 712 (95\%) placebo. The distribution of modified Rankin Scale categories was similar in the 2 groups (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.92 [95\% CI, 0.76\textendash 1.10]). Patients allocated fluoxetine scored worse on memory with a median value of 89 (interquartile range, 75\textendash 100) versus 93 (interquartile range, 82\textendash 100); P=0.0021 and communication 93 (interquartile range, 82\textendash 100) versus 96 (interquartile range, 86\textendash 100); P=0.024 domains of the Stroke Impact Scale compared with placebo. There were no other differences in secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Fluoxetine after acute stroke had no effect on functional outcome at 12 months. Patients allocated fluoxetine scored worse on memory and communication on the Stroke Impact Scale compared with placebo, but this is likely to be due to chance.},

When researchers are concerned about unknown confounders, plausible values for these bias parameters will be difficult to specify. Ding and VanderWeele developed bounding factor and E-value approaches that require the user to specify only some of the bias parameters. We describe the mathematical meaning of bounding factors and E-values and the plausibility of these methods in an applied context. We encourage researchers to pay particular attention to the assumption made, when using E-values, that the prevalence of the uncontrolled confounder among the exposed is 100\% (or, equivalently, the prevalence of the exposure among those without the confounder is 0\%). We contrast methods that attempt to bound biases or effects and alternative approaches such as quantitative bias analysis. We provide an example where failure to make this distinction led to erroneous statements. If the primary concern in an analysis is with known but unmeasured potential confounders, then E-values are not needed and may be misleading. In cases where the concern is with unknown confounders, the E-value assumption of an extreme possible prevalence of the confounder limits its practical utility.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To examine factors associated with variation in LTAC vs SNF transfer among hospitalized older adults. Supplemental content DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted this retrospective observational cohort study of hospitalized older adults (Ն65 years) transferred to an LTAC vs SNF during fiscal year 2012 using national 5\% Medicare data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Predictors of LTAC transfer were assessed using a multilevel mixed-effects model adjusting for patient-, hospital-, and region-level factors. We estimated variation partition coefficients and adjusted hospital- and region-specific LTAC transfer rates using sequential models. RESULTS Among 65 525 hospitalized older adults (42 461 [64.8\%] women; 39 908 [60.9\%] Ն85 years) transferred to an LTAC or SNF, 3093 (4.7\%) were transferred to an LTAC. We identified 29 patient-, 3 hospital-, and 5 region-level independent predictors. The strongest predictors of LTAC transfer were receiving a tracheostomy (adjusted odds ration [aOR], 23.8; 95\% CI, 15.8-35.9) and being hospitalized in close proximity to an LTAC (0-2 vs {$>$}42 miles; aOR, 8.4, 95\% CI, 6.1-11.5). After adjusting for case-mix, differences between patients explained 52.1\% (95\% CI, 47.7\%-56.5\%) of the variation in LTAC use. The remainder was attributable to hospital (15.0\%; 95\% CI, 12.3\%-17.6\%), and regional differences (32.9\%; 95\% CI, 27.6\%-38.3\%). Case-mix adjusted LTAC use was very high in the South (17\%-37\%) compared with the Pacific Northwest, North, and Northeast ({$<$}2.2\%). From the full multilevel model, the median adjusted hospital LTAC transfer rate was 2.1\% (10th-90th percentile, 0.24\%-10.8\%). Even within a region, adjusted hospital LTAC transfer rates varied substantially (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 0.26; 95\% CI, 0.23-0.30). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although many patient-level factors were associated with LTAC use, half of the variation in LTAC vs SNF transfer is independent of patients' illness severity or clinical complexity, and is explained by where the patient was hospitalized and in what region, with far greater use in the South. Even among hospitals in regions with similar LTAC access, there was considerable variation in LTAC use. Given the higher expense associated with LTACs vs SNFs, greater attention is needed to define the optimal role of LTACs in the postacute care of older adults.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE               The objective of this study was to determine patterns of care and outcomes in ruptured intracranial aneurysms (IAs) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in a contemporary national cohort.                                         METHODS               The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of prospective data from a nationwide multicenter registry of all aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) cases admitted to a tertiary care neurosurgical department in Switzerland in the years 2009\textendash 2015 (Swiss Study on Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage [Swiss SOS]). Patterns of care and outcomes at discharge and the 1-year follow-up in MCA aneurysm (MCAA) patients were analyzed and compared with those in a control group of patients with IAs in locations other than the MCA (non-MCAA patients). Independent predictors of a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score {$\leq$} 3) were identified, and their effect size was determined.                                         RESULTS               Among 1866 consecutive aSAH patients, 413 (22.1\%) harbored an MCAA. These MCAA patients presented with higher World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grades (p = 0.007), showed a higher rate of concomitant intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH; 41.9\% vs 16.7\%, p {$<$} 0.001), and experienced delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) more frequently (38.9\% vs 29.4\%, p = 0.001) than non-MCAA patients. After adjustment for confounders, patients with MCAA were as likely as non-MCAA patients to experience DCI (aOR 1.04, 95\% CI 0.74\textendash 1.45, p = 0.830). Surgical treatment was the dominant treatment modality in MCAA patients and at a significantly higher rate than in non-MCAA patients (81.7\% vs 36.7\%, p {$<$} 0.001). An MCAA location was a strong independent predictor of surgical treatment (aOR 8.49, 95\% CI 5.89\textendash 12.25, p {$<$} 0.001), despite statistical adjustment for variables traditionally associated with surgical treatment, such as (space-occupying) ICH (aOR 1.73, 95\% CI 1.23\textendash 2.45, p = 0.002). Even though MCAA patients were less likely to die during the acute hospitalization (aOR 0.52, 0.30\textendash 0.91, p = 0.022), their rate of a favorable outcome was lower at discharge than that in non-MCAA patients (55.7\% vs 63.7\%, p = 0.003). At the 1-year follow-up, 68.5\% and 69.6\% of MCAA and non-MCAA patients, respectively, had a favorable outcome (p = 0.676).                                         CONCLUSIONS               Microsurgical occlusion remains the predominant treatment choice for about 80\% of ruptured MCAAs in a European industrialized country. Although patients with MCAAs presented with worse admission grades and greater rates of concomitant ICH, in-hospital mortality was lower and long-term disability was comparable to those in patients with non-MCAA.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The global burden of sepsis is estimated as 15 to 19 million cases annually, with a mortality rate approaching 60\% in low-income countries. METHODS: In this retrospective before-after clinical study, we compared the outcome and clinical course of consecutive septic patients treated with intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine during a 7-month period (treatment group) with a control group treated in our ICU during the preceding 7 months. The primary outcome was hospital survival. A propensity score was generated to adjust the primary outcome. RESULTS: There were 47 patients in both treatment and control groups, with no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. The hospital mortality was 8.5\% (4 of 47) in the treatment group compared with 40.4\% (19 of 47) in the control group (P {$<$} .001). The propensity adjusted odds of mortality in the patients treated with the vitamin C protocol was 0.13 (95\% CI, 0.04-0.48; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .002). The Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment score decreased in all patients in the treatment group, with none developing progressive organ failure. All patients in the treatment group were weaned off vasopressors, a mean of 18.3 \AE{} 9.8 h after starting treatment with the vitamin C protocol. The mean duration of vasopressor use was 54.9 \AE{} 28.4 h in the control group (P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the early use of intravenous vitamin C, together with corticosteroids and thiamine, are effective in preventing progressive organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, and in reducing the mortality of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Additional studies are required to confirm these preliminary findings.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We evaluated whether stroke severity, functional outcome, and mortality are different in patients with ischemic stroke with or without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. METHODS: A prospective, observational, multicentre cohort study in Catalonia, Spain. Recruitment was consecutive from midMarch to mid-May 2020. Patients had an acute ischemic stroke within 48 hours and a previous modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 to 3. We collected demographic data, vascular risk factors, prior mRS score, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, rate of reperfusion therapies, logistics, and metrics. Primary end point was functional outcome at 3 months. Favourable outcome was defined depending on the previous mRS score. Secondary outcome was mortality at 3 months. We performed mRS shift and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: We evaluated 701 patients (mean age 72.3{$\pm$}13.3 years, 60.5\% men) and 91 (13\%) had COVID-19 infection. Median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was higher in patients with COVID-19 compared with patients without COVID-19 (8 [3\textendash 18] versus 6 [2\textendash 14], P=0.049). Proportion of patients with a favourable functional outcome was 33.7\% in the COVID-19 and 47\% in the non-COVID-19 group. However, after a multivariable logistic regression analysis, COVID-19 infection did not increase the probability of unfavourable functional outcome. Mortality rate was 39.3\% among patients with COVID-19 and 16.1\% in the non-COVID-19 group. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, COVID-19 infection was a risk factor for mortality (hazard ratio, 3.14 [95\% CI, 2.10\textendash 4.71]; P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ischemic stroke and COVID-19 infection have more severe strokes and a higher mortality than patients with stroke without COVID-19 infection. However, functional outcome is comparable in both groups.},

  abstract = {Certain drugs may increase the risk of ischemic stroke (IS). Our goal was to review associations between frequently used drugs and IS. We created an initial list of frequently used drugs to search Pubmed/MEDLINE from 1966 to 2020 and reviewed phase III and IV data, case series, and drug authorities' safety warnings to assess a potential association with IS. Drugs were grouped according to the World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System. Predefined criteria were applied to establish a level of evidence for an association, from A (high level of evidence of association) to E (high level of evidence of absence of association). In addition, we assessed relative risks and reviewed potential mechanisms of IS facilitation. We assessed 81 drugs or drug classes from 11 World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Groups. We identified a high level of association for erythropoietin, combined contraceptives, oral estrogen replacement therapy, bevacizumab, tamoxifen, and antipsychotics and a moderate level for ponatinib, nilotinib, darunavir, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. Drug dose and treatment duration may modify the risk. For a substantial number of drugs, we found no association, and for others, there were insufficient data to categorize risk. We identified a high level of association of IS with a limited number of drugs, a potential association with some, and a lack of data for others. The summarized information may help clinicians to estimate the contribution of a drug to an IS, to better assess drug benefit-risk ratios, and to support decisions about using specific drugs.},

Methods\textemdash We included endovascular thrombectomy\textendash treated patients registered from 2014 to 2017 in the Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke International Thrombectomy Registry. The mean 24-hour SBP after endovascular thrombectomy treatment was analyzed both as a continuous variable and in intervals. The primary outcome was 3-month functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score of 0\textendash 2). The secondary outcomes were symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) and 3-month mortality. The SBP interval with the highest proportion of functional independence was chosen as reference. All analyses were performed for successful or unsuccessful recanalization (modified Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia score {$\geq$}2b or {$<$}2b, respectively). The results were adjusted for known confounders in logistic regression models. Results\textemdash In the multivariable analyses, a higher SBP value as a continuous variable was associated unfavorably with all outcomes in patients with successful recanalization (n=2920) and with more SICH in patients with unsuccessful recanalization (n=711). SBP interval {$\geq$}160 mm\,Hg was associated with less functional independence (adjusted odds ratio, 0.28 [95\% CIs, 0.15\textendash 0.53]) and more SICH (adjusted odds ratio, 6.82 [95\% CIs, 1.53\textendash 38.09]) compared with reference 100 to 119 mm\,Hg in patients with successful recanalization.

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash Hematoma growth occurs in 38\% of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients scanned by computed tomography (CT) within 3 hours of onset. Activated recombinant factor VII (rFVIIa) promotes hemostasis at sites of vascular injury and may minimize hematoma growth after ICH. Methods\textemdash In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial, 48 subjects with ICH diagnosed within 3 hours of onset were treated with placebo (nϭ12) or rFVIIa (10, 20, 40, 80, 120, or 160 ␮g/kg; nϭ6 per group). The primary endpoint was the frequency of adverse events (AEs). Safety assessments included serial electrocardiography (ECG), troponin I and coagulation testing, lower extremity Doppler ultrasonography, and calculation of edema:ICH volume ratios. Results\textemdash Mean age was 61 years (range, 30 to 93) and 57\% were male. At admission, mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 14 (range, 1 to 26), median Glasgow Coma Scale score was 14 (range, 6 to 15), and mean ICH volume was 21 mL (range, 1 to 151). Mean time from onset to treatment was 181 minutes (range, 120 to 265). Twelve serious AEs occurred, including 5 deaths (mortality 11\%). Six AEs were considered possibly treatment-related, including rash, vomiting, fever, ECG T-wave inversion, and 2 cases of deep vein thrombosis (placebo and 20-␮g/kg groups). No myocardial ischemia, consumption coagulopathy, or dose-related increase in edema:ICH volume occurred. Conclusion\textemdash This small phase II trial evaluated a wide range of rFVIIa doses in acute ICH and raised no major safety concerns. Larger studies are justified to determine whether rFVIIa can safely and effectively limit ICH growth. (Stroke. 2005;36:74-79.)},

Previously, CTA was reserved for patients presenting within 6 hours with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score {$\geq$}6. We compared treatment processes and outcomes between patients with AIS admitted 1 year before (n=388) and after (n=515) protocol implementation.Results\textemdash After protocol implementation, more AIS patients underwent CTA (91\% versus 61\%; P{$<$}0.001) and had CTA performed at the same time as the initial noncontrast computed tomography scan (78\% versus 35\%; P{$<$}0.001). Median time from emergency department arrival to CTA was also shorter (29 [interquartile range, 16\textendash 53] versus 43 [interquartile range, 29\textendash 112] minutes; P{$<$}0.001), more cases of LVO were detected (166 versus 96; 32\% versus 25\% of all AIS; P=0.014), and more mechanical thrombectomy procedures were performed (108 versus 68; 21\% versus 18\% of all AIS; P=0.196). Among LVO patients who presented within 6 hours of last known well, median time from last known well to mechanical thrombectomy was shorter (3.5 [interquartile range, 2.8\textendash 4.8] versus 4.1 [interquartile range, 3.3\textendash 5.6] hours; P=0.038), and more patients were discharged with a favorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale 4\textendash 5, 53\% versus 37\%; P=0.029).

  abstract = {Background: Diagnostic uncertainty occurs frequently in emergency medical care, with more than one-third of patients leaving the emergency department (ED) without a clear diagnosis. Despite this frequency, ED providers are not adequately trained on how to discuss diagnostic uncertainty with these patients, who often leave the ED confused and concerned. To address this training need, we developed the Uncertainty Communication Education Module (UCEM) to teach physicians how to discuss diagnostic uncertainty. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the UCEM in improving physician communications. Methods: The trial is a multicenter, two-arm randomized controlled trial designed to teach communication skills using simulation-based mastery learning (SBML). Resident emergency physicians from two training programs will be randomly assigned to immediate or delayed receipt of the two-part UCEM intervention after completing a baseline standardized patient encounter. The two UCEM components are: 1) a web-based interactive module, and 2) a smart-phone-based game. Both formats teach and reinforce communication skills for patient cases involving diagnostic uncertainty. Following baseline testing, participants in the immediate intervention arm will complete a remote deliberate practice session via a video platform and subsequently return for a second study visit to assess if they have achieved mastery. Participants in the delayed intervention arm will receive access to UCEM and remote deliberate practice after the second study visit. The primary outcome of interest is the proportion of residents in the immediate intervention arm who achieve mastery at the second study visit. Discussion: Patients' understanding of the care they received has implications for care quality, safety, and patient satisfaction, especially when they are discharged without a definitive diagnosis. Developing a patient-centered diagnostic uncertainty communication strategy will improve safety of acute care discharges. Although use of SBML is a resource intensive educational approach, this trial has been deliberately designed to have a low-resource, scalable intervention that would allow for widespread dissemination and uptake. Trial registration: The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04021771). Registration date: July 16, 2019.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To prospectively assess outcomes in major areas of life function at 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months after msTBI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study, as part of the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI) study, was conducted at 18 level 1 trauma centers in the US from February 2014 to August 2018 and prospectively assessed longitudinal outcomes, with follow-up to 12 months postinjury. Participants were patients with msTBI (Glasgow Coma Scale scores 3-12) extracted from a larger group of patients with mild, moderate, or severe TBI who were enrolled in TRACK-TBI. Data analysis took place from October 2019 to April 2021. EXPOSURES Moderate or severe TBI. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The Glasgow Outcome Scale\textendash Extended (GOSE) and Disability Rating Scale (DRS) were used to assess global functional status 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury. Scores on the GOSE were dichotomized to determine favorable (scores 4-8) vs unfavorable (scores 1-3) outcomes. Neurocognitive testing and patient reported outcomes at 12 months postinjury were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 484 eligible patients were included from the 2679 individuals in the TRACK-TBI study. Participants with severe TBI (n = 362; 283 men [78.2\%]; median [interquartile range] age, 35.5 [25-53] years) and moderate TBI (n = 122; 98 men [80.3\%]; median [interquartile range] age, 38 [25-53] years) were comparable on demographic and premorbid variables. At 2 weeks postinjury, 36 of 290 participants with severe TBI (12.4\%) and 38 of 93 participants with moderate TBI (41\%) had favorable outcomes (GOSE scores 4-8); 301 of 322 in the severe TBI group (93.5\%) and 81 of 103 in the moderate TBI group (78.6\%) had moderate disability or worse on the DRS (total score Ն4). By 12 months postinjury, 142 of 271 with severe TBI (52.4\%) and 54 of 72 with moderate TBI (75\%) achieved favorable outcomes. Nearly 1 in 5 participants with severe TBI (52 of 270 [19.3\%]) and 1 in 3 with moderate TBI (23 of 71 [32\%]) reported no disability (DRS score 0) at 12 months. Among participants in a vegetative state at 2 weeks, 62 of 79 (78\%) regained consciousness and 14 of 56 with available data (25\%) regained orientation by 12 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, patients with msTBI frequently demonstrated major functional gains, including recovery of independence, between 2 weeks and 12 months postinjury. Severe impairment in the short term did not portend poor outcomes in a substantial minority of patients with msTBI. When discussing prognosis during the first 2 weeks after injury, clinicians should be particularly cautious about making early, definitive prognostic statements suggesting poor outcomes and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment in patients with msTBI.},

  abstract = {Objectives: It is uncertain whether dedicated neurocritical care units are associated with improved outcomes for critically ill neurologically injured patients in the era of collaborative protocol-driven care. We examined the association between dedicated neurocritical care units and mortality and the effects of standardized management protocols for severe traumatic brain injury. Design: We surveyed trauma medical directors from centers participating in the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program to obtain information about ICU structure and processes of care. Survey data were then linked to the Trauma Quality Improvement Program registry, and random-intercept hierarchical multivariable modeling was used to evaluate the association between dedicated neurocritical care units, the presence of standardized management protocols and mortality. Setting: Trauma centers in North America participating in Trauma Quality Improvement Program. Patients: Data were analyzed from 9,773 adult patients with isolated severe traumatic brain injury admitted to 134 Trauma Quality Improvement Program centers between 2011 and 2013. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Only 50 ICUs (37\&percnt;) were dedicated neurocritical care units, whereas 84 (63\&percnt;) were general ICUs. Rates of standardized management protocols were similar comparing dedicated neurocritical care units and general ICUs. Among severe TBI patients admitted to trauma centers enrolled in Trauma Quality Improvement Program, care in a dedicated neurocritical care unit did not improve risk-adjusted in-hospital survival (odds ratio, 0.97; 95\&percnt; CI, 0.80\textendash 1.19; p = 0.79). However, the presence of a standardized management protocol for these patients was associated with lower risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.77; 95\&percnt; CI, 0.63\textendash 0.93; p = 0.009). Conclusions: Compared with dedicated neurocritical care models, standardized management protocols for severe traumatic brain injured patients are process-targeted intervention strategies that may improve clinical outcomes.}

CSCs have been shown to improve clinical outcomes and mitigate disparities in ischemic stroke patients. It is believed that CSCs also improve outcomes in hemorrhagic stroke. We used the Myocardial Infarction Data Acquisition System (MIDAS) database, which includes data on patients discharged with a primary diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH; International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] 431) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH; ICD-9 430) from all nonfederal acute care hospitals in New Jersey (NJ) between 1996 and 2012. Out-of-hospital deaths were assessed by matching MIDAS records with NJ death registration files. The primary outcome variable was 90-day all-cause mortality. The primary independent variable was CSC versus primary stroke center (PSC) and nonstroke center (NSC) admission. Multivariate logistic models were used to measure the effects of available covariates. Overall, 36 981 patients were admitted with a primary diagnosis of ICH or SAH during the study period, of which 40\% were admitted to a CSC. Patients admitted to CSCs were more likely to have neurosurgical or endovascular interventions than those admitted to a PSC/NSC (18.9\% vs. 4.7\%; P{$<$}0.0001). CSC admission was associated with lower adjusted 90-day mortality (35.0\% vs. 40.3\%; odds ratio, 0.93; 95\% confidence interval, 0.89 to 0.97) for hemorrhagic stroke. This was particularly true for those admitted with SAH. Hemorrhagic stroke patients admitted to CSCs are more likely to receive neurosurgical and endovascular treatments and be alive at 90 days than patients admitted to other hospitals.}

In this article, we review research on how applied researchers who are not primarily statisticians misuse and misinterpret p-values in practice and how this can lead to errors in the interpretation of evidence. We also present new data showing, perhaps surprisingly, that researchers who are primarily statisticians are also prone to misuse and misinterpret p-values thus resulting in similar errors. In particular, we show that statisticians tend to interpret evidence dichotomously based on whether or not a p-value crosses the conventional 0.05 threshold for statistical significance. We discuss implications and offer recommendations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage accounts for 20\% of all stroke-related sudden neurological deficits, has the highest morbidity and mortality of all stroke, and the role of surgery remains controversial. We undertook a prospective randomised trial to compare early surgery with initial conservative treatment for patients with intracerebral haemorrhage. METHODS: A parallel-group trial design was used. Early surgery combined haematoma evacuation (within 24 h of randomisation) with medical treatment. Initial conservative treatment used medical treatment, although later evacuation was allowed if necessary. We used the eight-point Glasgow outcome scale obtained by postal questionnaires sent directly to patients at 6 months follow-up as the primary outcome measure. We divided the patients into good and poor prognosis groups on the basis of their clinical status at randomisation. For the good prognosis group, a favourable outcome was defined as good recovery or moderate disability on the Glasgow outcome scale. For the poor prognosis group, a favourable outcome also included the upper level of severe disability. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: 1033 patients from 83 centres in 27 countries were randomised to early surgery (503) or initial conservative treatment (530). At 6 months, 51 patients were lost to follow-up, and 17 were alive with unknown status. Of 468 patients randomised to early surgery, 122 (26\%) had a favourable outcome compared with 118 (24\%) of 496 randomised to initial conservative treatment (odds ratio 0.89 [95\% CI 0.66-1.19], p=0.414); absolute benefit 2.3\% (-3.2 to 7.7), relative benefit 10\% (-13 to 33). INTERPRETATION: Patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage in neurosurgical units show no overall benefit from early surgery when compared with initial conservative treatment.},

METHODS: This retrospective, multicenter study compares EVT and best medical treatment for computed tomography (CT)\textendash based selection of patients with extensive baseline infarcts (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score {$\leq$}5) attributed to anterior circulation stroke. Patients were selected from the German Stroke Registry and 3 tertiary stroke centers. Primary functional end points were rates of good (modified Rankin Scale score of {$\leq$}3) and very poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of {$\geq$}5) at 90 days. Secondary safety end point was the occurrence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. Angiographic outcome was evaluated with the modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction Scale. RESULTS: After 1:1 pair matching, a total of 248 patients were compared by treatment arm. Good functional outcome was observed in 27.4\% in the EVT group, and in 25\% in the best medical treatment group (P=0.665). Advanced age (adjusted odds ratio, 1.08 [95\% CI, 1.05\textendash 1.10], P{$<$}0.001) and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio, 6.35 [95\% CI, 2.08\textendash 19.35], P{$<$}0.001) were independently associated with very poor outcome. Mortality (43.5\% versus 28.9\%, P=0.025) and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (16.1\% versus 5.6\%, P=0.008) were significantly higher in the EVT group. The lowest rates of good functional outcome ({$\approx$}15\%) were observed in groups of failed and partial recanalization (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction Scale score of 0/1\textendash 2a), whereas patients with complete recanalization (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction Scale score of 3) with recanalization attempts {$\leq$}2 benefitted the most (modified Rankin Scale score of {$\leq$}3:42.3\%, P=0.074) compared with best medical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In daily clinical practice, EVT for CT\textendash based selected patients with low Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score anterior circulation stroke may not be beneficial and is associated with increased risk for hemorrhage and mortality, especially in the elderly. However, first- or second-pass complete recanalization seems to reveal a clinical benefit of EVT highlighting the vulnerability of the low Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score subgroup.},

Besides the initial aim to improve the quality of patient care, EBM is used in the meanwhile for political and economic decision-making and legal issues as well. A review of the literature was performed, followed by a search using links and references of the detected articles. Additionally, homepages for German institutions of public health were screened. Substantial limitations of RCTs and EBM health care could be identified. Based on the selected literature, 80\% of the medical treatments have low evidence. RCTs are expensive and are mainly performed by the industry nowadays. A publication bias for positive results exists. Some RCTs are of low external validity. Many studies have a low fragility index. Nonetheless, negative RCTs could be of benefit for the patients. The results of RCTs, gained in a distinct patient population, are partially generalized. RCTs should be analyzed critically before adopting the results to daily clinical routine. It is not really justified to use RCTs and EBM for political and economic decisionmaking and legal issues as seen today.},

While convulsive status epilepticus can be diagnosed using clinical features alone, non-convulsive status epilepticus requires confirmation by electroencephalogram. Early seizure control remains key in preventing the complications of status epilepticus. This is especially true for convulsive status epilepticus, which has stronger evidence supporting the benefit of treatment on outcomes. When status epilepticus becomes refractory, often due to gamma-aminobutyric acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor modulation, anaesthetic drugs are needed to suppress seizure activity, of which there is limited evidence regarding the selection, dose or duration of their use. Seizure monitoring with electroencephalogram is often needed when patients do not return to baseline or during anaesthetic wean; however, it is resource-intensive, costly, only available in highly specialised centres and has not been shown to improve functional outcomes. Thus, the treatment goals and aggressiveness of therapy remain under debate, especially for non-convulsive status epilepticus, where prolonged therapeutic coma can lead to severe complications. This review presents an evidence-based, clinically-oriented and comprehensive review of status epilepticus and its definitions, aetiologies, treatments, outcomes and prognosis at different stages of the patient's journey.},

  abstract = {Summary: Analysis of patient data from a new neuroscience intensive care unit (NSICU) permitted evaluation of whether such a specialty ICU favorably altered clinical outcomes in critically ill neuroscience patients, and whether such a care model produced an efficient use of resources. A retrospective review was performed to compare (1) the clinical outcomes, as defined by percent mortality and disposition at discharge, between patients with a primary diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage treated in 1995 in medical or surgical ICUs and those treated in the same medical facility in an NSICU in 1997; and (2) the efficiency of care, as defined by length of ICU stay, total cost of care, and specific resource use, between patients treated in the NSICU and national benchmark standards for general ICUs during the 1997 fiscal year (FY). In the latter, extracted patient population data on neurosurgery patients requiring ICU treatment during FY 1997 were used with the following adjacent-disease related group (A-DRG)-coded diseases: craniotomy with and without coma or intracerebral hemorrhage, and skull fracture with and without coma lasting longer than 1 hour. Outcome measures of percent mortality and disposition at discharge in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage were significantly improved (P {$<$} .05), compared with those in a similar cohort treated 2 years earlier in a general ICU setting. Also, patients treated in the NSICU had shorter hospital stays (P {$<$} .01) and lower total costs of care (P {$<$} .01) than a national benchmark. The data suggest that a neuroscience specialty ICU arena staffed by specialty-trained intensivists and nurses is beneficial.}

  abstract = {National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), measured a few hours to days after stroke onset, is an attractive outcome measure for stroke research. NIHSS at the time of presentation (baseline NIHSS) strongly predicts the follow-up NIHSS. Because of the need to account for the baseline NIHSS in the analysis of follow-up NIHSS as an outcome measure, a common and intuitive approach is to define study outcome as the change in NIHSS from baseline to follow-up ({$\increment$}NIHSS). However, this approach has important limitations. Analyzing {$\increment$}NIHSS implies a very strong assumption about the relationship between baseline and follow-up NIHSS that is unlikely to be satisfied, drawing into question the validity of the resulting statistical analysis. This reduces the precision of the estimates of treatment effects and the power of clinical trials that use this approach to analysis. ANCOVA allows for the analysis of follow-up NIHSS as the dependent variable while adjusting for baseline NIHSS as a covariate in the model and addresses several challenges of using {$\increment$}NIHSS outcome using simple bivariate comparisons (eg, a t test, Wilcoxon rank-sum, linear regression without adjustment for baseline) for stroke research. In this article, we use clinical trial simulations to illustrate that variability in NIHSS outcome is less when follow-up NIHSS is adjusted for baseline compared to {$\increment$}NIHSS and how a reduction in this variability improves the power. We outline additional, important clinical and statistical arguments to support the superiority of ANCOVA using the final measurement of the NIHSS adjusted for baseline over, and caution against using, the simple bivariate comparison of absolute NIHSS change (ie, delta).},

Clinical scoring systems can predict the mortality and functional outcome after ICH (FUNC score). FOUR score is a recently developed coma scale that incorporates brainstem reflexes.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all S-ICH patients ({$>$}18 years of age) from January 2008 to May 2010. ICH volume was calculated using the ABC/2 formula. FUNC ({$\leq$}5 or {$>$}5) and FOUR ({$\leq$}10 and {$>$}10) scores were calculated from admission data. Statistical analyses included chi-square test, positive predictive value, and relative risk assessment. Results: Total number of patients was 92. The mean age of presentation was 64.6 {$\pm$} 15.6 years (range: 27\textendash 95 years). Male to female ratio was 1.6:1. Combined FUNC score {$\leq$} 5 and FOUR score {$\leq$} 10 (F2 score; 95\%) had higher positive predictive value for mortality than either FUNC score {$\leq$} 5 (82\%) or FOUR score {$\leq$} 10 (81\%).

Methods The Ethnic/Racial Variations in Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH) study is a prospective multicenter study of ICH among adult (age {$\geq$}18 years) non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic participants. The study recruited 1,000 participants per racial/ethnic group. The present study utilized the subset of ERICH participants aged {$<$}50 years with supratentorial ICH. Functional outcome was ascertained using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with poor outcome (mRS 4\textendash 6), and analyses were compared by race/ethnicity to identify differences across these groups. Results Of the 3,000 patients with ICH enrolled in ERICH, 418 were studied (mean age 43 years, 69\% male), of whom 48 (12\%) were white, 173 (41\%) were black, and 197 (47\%) were Hispanic. For supratentorial ICH, black participants (odds ratio [OR], 0.42; p = 0.046) and Hispanic participants (OR, 0.34; p = 0.01) had better outcomes than white participants after adjustment for other factors associated with poor outcome: age, baseline disability, admission blood pressure, admission Glasgow Coma Scale score, ICH volume, deep ICH location, and intraventricular extension. Conclusions In young patients with supratentorial ICH, black and Hispanic race/ethnicity is associated with better functional outcomes, compared with white race. Additional studies are needed to identify the biological and social mediators of this association.},

Without transparent reporting, readers cannot judge the reliability and validity of trial findings nor extract information for systematic reviews. Recent methodological analyses indicate that inadequate reporting and design are associated with biased estimates of treatment effects. Such systematic error is seriously damaging to RCTs, which are considered the gold standard for evaluating interventions because of their ability to minimise or avoid bias. A group of scientists and editors developed the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement to improve the quality of reporting of RCTs. It was first published in 1996 and updated in 2001. The statement consists of a checklist and flow diagram that authors can use for reporting an RCT. Many leading medical journals and major international editorial groups have endorsed the CONSORT statement. The statement facilitates critical appraisal and interpretation of RCTs. During the 2001 CONSORT revision, it became clear that explanation and elaboration of the principles underlying the CONSORT statement would help investigators and others to write or appraise trial reports. A CONSORT explanation and elaboration article was published in 2001 alongside the 2001 version of the CONSORT statement. After an expert meeting in January 2007, the CONSORT statement has been further revised and is published as the CONSORT 2010 Statement. This update improves the wording and clarity of the previous checklist and incorporates recommendations related to topics that have only recently received recognition, such as selective outcome reporting bias. This explanatory and elaboration document\textemdash intended to enhance the use, understanding, and dissemination of the CONSORT statement\textemdash has also been extensively revised. It presents the meaning and rationale for each new and updated checklist item providing examples of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies. Several examples of flow diagrams are included. The CONSORT 2010 Statement, this revised explanatory and elaboration document, and the associated website (www. consort-statement.org) should be helpful resources to improve reporting of randomised trials.},

However, scholars often unwittingly distort treatment effect estimates by conditioning on variables that could be affected by their experimental manipulation. Typical examples include controlling for posttreatment variables in statistical models, eliminating observations based on posttreatment criteria, or subsetting the data based on posttreatment variables. Though these modeling choices are intended to address common problems encountered when conducting experiments, they can bias estimates of causal effects. Moreover, problems associated with conditioning on posttreatment variables remain largely unrecognized in the field, which we show frequently publishes experimental studies using these practices in our discipline's most prestigious journals. We demonstrate the severity of experimental posttreatment bias analytically and document the magnitude of the potential distortions it induces using visualizations and reanalyses of real-world data. We conclude by providing applied researchers with recommendations for best practice.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To explore practitioner understanding of diagnostic reasoning. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this survey study, 723 practitioners at outpatient clinics in 8 US states were asked to estimate the probability of disease for 4 scenarios common in primary care (pneumonia, cardiac ischemia, breast cancer screening, and urinary tract infection) and the association of positive and negative test results with disease probability from June 1, 2018, to November 26, 2019. Of these practitioners, 585 responded to the survey, and 553 answered all of the questions. An expert panel developed the survey and determined correct responses based on literature review. RESULTS A total of 553 (290 resident physicians, 202 attending physicians, and 61 nurse practitioners and physician assistants) of 723 practitioners (76.5\%) fully completed the survey (median age, 32 years; interquartile range, 29-44 years; 293 female [53.0\%]; 296 [53.5\%] White). Pretest probability was overestimated in all scenarios. Probabilities of disease after positive results were overestimated as follows: pneumonia after positive radiology results, 95\% (evidence range, 46\%-65\%; comparison P {$<$} .001); breast cancer after positive mammography results, 50\% (evidence range, 3\%-9\%; P {$<$} .001); cardiac ischemia after positive stress test result, 70\% (evidence range, 2\%-11\%; P {$<$} .001); and urinary tract infection after positive urine culture result, 80\% (evidence range, 0\%-8.3\%; P {$<$} .001). Overestimates of probability of disease with negative results were also observed as follows: pneumonia after negative radiography results, 50\% (evidence range, 10\%-19\%; P {$<$} .001); breast cancer after negative mammography results, 5\% (evidence range, {$<$}0.05\%; P {$<$} .001); cardiac ischemia after negative stress test result, 5\% (evidence range, 0.43\%-2.5\%; P {$<$} .001); and urinary tract infection after negative urine culture result, 5\% (evidence range, 0\%-0.11\%; P {$<$} .001). Probability adjustments in response to test results varied from accurate to overestimates of risk by type of test (imputed median positive and negative likelihood ratios [LRs] for practitioners for chest radiography for pneumonia: positive LR, 4.8; evidence, 2.6; negative LR, 0.3; evidence, 0.3; mammography for breast cancer: positive LR, 44.3; evidence range, 13.0-33.0; negative LR, 1.0; evidence range, 0.05-0.24; exercise stress test for cardiac ischemia: positive LR, 21.0; evidence range, 2.0-2.7; negative LR, 0.6; evidence range, 0.5-0.6; urine culture for urinary tract infection: positive LR, 9.0; evidence, 9.0; negative LR, 0.1; evidence, 0.1). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This survey study suggests that for common diseases and tests, practitioners overestimate the probability of disease before and after testing. Pretest probability was overestimated in all scenarios, whereas adjustment in probability after a positive or negative result varied by test. Widespread overestimates of the probability of disease likely contribute to overdiagnosis and overuse.},

The survey was an in-person, paper, 26-item survey in which clinicians were asked to estimate the probability of adverse disease outcomes and expected effects of therapies for diseases common in primary care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Estimated chance that treatments would benefit an individual patient. RESULTS Of 723 clinicians, 585 (81\%) responded, and 542 completed all the questions necessary for analysis, with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 32 (29-44) years, 287 (53\%) women, and 294 (54\%) White participants. Clinicians consistently overestimated the chance that treatments would benefit an individual patient. The median (IQR) estimated chance that warfarin would prevent a stroke in the next year was 50\% (5\%-80\%) compared with scientific evidence, which indicates an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 0.2\% to 1.0\% based on a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 39\% to 50\%. The median (IQR) estimated chance that antihypertensive therapy would prevent a cardiovascular event within 5 years was 30\% (10\%-70\%) vs evidence of an ARR of 0\% to 3\% based on an RRR of 0\% to 28\%. The median (IQR) estimated chance that bisphosphonate therapy would prevent a hip fracture in the next 5 years was 40\% (10\%-60\%) vs evidence of ARR of 0.1\% to 0.4\% based on an RRR of 20\% to 40\%. The median (IQR) estimated chance that moderate-intensity statin therapy would prevent a cardiovascular event in the next 5 years was 20\% (IQR 5\%-50\%) vs evidence of an ARR of 0.3\% to 2\% based on an RRR of 19\% to 33\%. Estimates of the chance that a treatment would prevent an adverse outcome exceeded estimates of the absolute chance of that outcome for 60\% to 70\% of clinicians. Clinicians whose overestimations were greater were more likely to report using that treatment for patients in their practice (eg, use of warfarin: correlation coefficient, 0.46; 95\% CI, 0.40-0.53; P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this survey study, clinicians significantly overestimated the benefits of treatment to individual patients. Clinicians with greater overestimates were more likely to report using treatments in actual patients.},

  abstract = {Objective: This study tested the hypothesis that patients without placement of new do-notresuscitate (DNR) orders during the first 5 days after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) have lower 30-day mortality than predicted by the ICH Score without an increase in severe disability at 90 days. Methods: This was a prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study at 4 academic medical centers and one community hospital. Adults (18 years or older) with nontraumatic spontaneous ICH, Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12 or less, who did not have preexisting DNR orders were included. Results: One hundred nine subjects were enrolled. Mean age was 62 years; median Glasgow Coma Scale score was 7, and mean hematoma volume was 39 cm3. Based on ICH Score prediction, the expected overall 30-day mortality rate was 50\%. Observed mortality was substantially lower at 20.2\%, absolute average difference 29.8\% (95\% confidence interval: 21.5\%\textendash 37.7\%). At 90 days, 27.1\% had died, 21.5\% had a modified Rankin Scale score 5 5 (severe disability). A good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0\textendash 3) was achieved by 29.9\% and an additional 21.5\% fell into the moderately severe disability range (modified Rankin Scale score 5 4). Conclusions: Avoidance of early DNR orders along with guideline concordant ICH care results in substantially lower mortality than predicted. The observed functional outcomes in this study provide clinicians and families with data to determine the appropriate goals of treatment based on patients' wishes.

  abstract = {Objective: To validate various noncontrast CT (NCCT) predictors of hematoma expansion in a large international cohort of ICH patients and investigate whether intensive blood pressure (BP) treatment reduces ICH growth and improves outcome in patients with these markers. Methods: We analyzed patients enrolled in the Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage II (ATACH-II) randomized controlled trial. Participants were assigned to intensive (systolic BP ,140 mm Hg) vs standard (systolic BP ,180 mm Hg) treatment within 4.5 hours from onset. The following NCCT markers were identified: intrahematoma hypodensities, black hole sign, swirl sign, blend sign, heterogeneous hematoma density, and irregular shape. ICH expansion was defined as hematoma growth .33\% and unfavorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score .3 at 90 days. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of ICH expansion and explore the association between NCCT signs and clinical benefit from intensive BP treatment. Results: A total of 989 patients were included (mean age 62 years, 61.9\% male), of whom 186/869 experienced hematoma expansion (21.4\%) and 361/952 (37.9\%) had unfavorable outcome. NCCT markers independently predicted ICH expansion (all p , 0.01) with overall accuracy ranging from 61\% to 78\% and good interrater reliability (k . 0.6 for all markers). There was no evidence of an interaction between NCCT markers and benefit from intensive BP reduction (all p for interaction .0.10). Conclusions: NCCT signs reliably identify ICH patients at high risk of hematoma growth. However, we found no evidence that patients with these markers specifically benefit from intensive BP reduction.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS SCORE-IT (Spot Sign Score in Restricting ICH Growth) is a preplanned prospective observational study nested in the Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage II (ATACH-II) randomized clinical trial. Participants included consecutive patients with primary ICH who underwent a CTA within 8 hours from onset at 59 sites from May 15, 2011, through December 19, 2015. Data were analyzed for the present study from July 1 to August 31, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Patients in ATACH-II were randomized to intensive (systolic BP target, {$<$}140 mm Hg) vs standard (systolic BP target, {$<$}180 mm Hg) BP reduction within 4.5 hours from onset. Expansion of ICH was defined as hematoma growth of greater than 33\%, and an unfavorable outcome was defined as a 90-day modified Rankin Scale score of 4 or greater (range, 0-6). The association among BP reduction, ICH expansion, and outcome was investigated with multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 133 patients (83 men [62.4\%] and 50 women [37.6\%]; mean [SD] age, 61.9 [13.1] years) were included. Of these, 53 (39.8\%) had a spot sign, and 24 of 123 without missing data (19.5\%) experienced ICH expansion. The spot sign was associated with expansion with sensitivity of 0.54 (95\% CI, 0.34-0.74) and specificity of 0.63 (95\% CI, 0.53-0.72). After adjustment for potential confounders, intensive BP treatment was not associated with a significant reduction of ICH expansion (relative risk, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.27-2.51; P = .74) or improved outcome (relative risk of 90-day modified Rankin Scale score Ն4, 1.24; 95\% CI, 0.53-2.91; P = .62) in spot sign\textendash positive patients.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The practice of platelet transfusion to mitigate the deleterious effects of antiplatelet agents on spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains common. However, the effect of antiplatelet agents on patients with ICH is still controversial and transfusing platelets is not without risk. We performed a meta-analysis in order to determine the effect of platelet transfusion on antiplatelet agent associated ICH. METHODS: We queried PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases to identify cohort studies, case-control studies, and randomized control trials. Study quality was graded by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, as appropriate. Outcomes of interest included functional independence as measured by the modified Rankin Scale and mortality. We compared patients with antiplatelet agent associated ICH who received platelet transfusion to those that did not. RESULTS: We identified 625 articles. After reviewing 44 full text articles, 5 were deemed appropriate for meta-analysis, including 4 cohort studies and one randomized control trial. Considerable heterogeneity was present among the studies (I2~{$>~$}81\% for all analyses). We did not find a significant effect of platelet transfusions on functional independence (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.3, 95\% CI.0.45-3.9) or mortality (OR 0.58, 95\% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.12-2.6). CONCLUSION: We found no evidence for an effect of platelet transfusions on functional independence or mortality following antiplatelet associated ICH. More randomized trials are needed to evaluate platelet transfusion in patients with ICH and proven reduced platelet activity or those requiring neurosurgical intervention.},

We performed a systematic scoping review of published methodological recommendations on how to systematically review and meta-analyse observational studies. Methods: We searched online databases and websites and contacted experts in the field to locate potentially eligible articles. We included articles that provided any type of recommendation on how to conduct systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies. We extracted and summarised recommendations on pre-defined key items: protocol development, research question, search strategy, study eligibility, data extraction, dealing with different study designs, risk of bias assessment, publication bias, heterogeneity, statistical analysis. We summarised recommendations by key item, identifying areas of agreement and disagreement as well as areas where recommendations were missing or scarce. Results: The searches identified 2461 articles of which 93 were eligible. Many recommendations for reviews and metaanalyses of observational studies were transferred from guidance developed for reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs. Although there was substantial agreement in some methodological areas there was also considerable disagreement on how evidence synthesis of observational studies should be conducted. Conflicting recommendations were seen on topics such as the inclusion of different study designs in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, the use of quality scales to assess the risk of bias, and the choice of model (e.g. fixed vs. random effects) for meta-analysis. Conclusion: There is a need for sound methodological guidance on how to conduct systematic reviews and metaanalyses of observational studies, which critically considers areas in which there are conflicting recommendations.},

However, the representativeness of these samples may be limited\textendash either through selection into studies, or by attrition from studies over time. Here we explore the potential impact of this selection bias on results obtained from these studies, from the perspective that this amounts to conditioning on a collider (i.e. a form of collider bias). Whereas it is acknowledged that selection bias will have a strong effect on representativeness and prevalence estimates, it is often assumed that it should not have a strong impact on estimates of associations. We argue that because selection can induce collider bias (which occurs when two variables independently influence a third variable, and that third variable is conditioned upon), selection can lead to substantially biased estimates of associations. In particular, selection related to phenotypes can bias associations with genetic variants associated with those phenotypes. In simulations, we show that even modest influences on selection into, or attrition from, a study can generate biased and potentially misleading estimates of both phenotypic and genotypic associations. Our results highlight the value of knowing which population your study sample is representative of. If the factors influencing selection and attrition are known, they can be adjusted for. For example, having DNA available on most participants in a birth cohort study offers the possibility of investigating the extent to which polygenic scores predict subsequent participation, which in turn would enable sensitivity analyses of the extent to which bias might distort estimates.},

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the associations of anticoagulation resumption with the subsequent risk of ICH recurrence and thromboembolism. Methods\textemdash We searched published medical literature to identify cohort studies involving adults with anticoagulationassociated ICH. Our predictor variable was resumption of anticoagulation. Outcome measures were thromboembolic events (stroke and myocardial infarction) and recurrence of ICH. After assessing study heterogeneity and publication bias, we performed a meta-analysis using random-effects models to assess the strength of association between anticoagulation resumption and our outcomes. Results\textemdash Eight studies were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis, with 5306 ICH patients. Almost all studies evaluated anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists. Reinitiation of anticoagulation was associated with a significantly lower risk of thromboembolic complications (pooled relative risk, 0.34; 95\% confidence interval, 0.25\textendash 0.45; Q=5.12, P for heterogeneity=0.28).

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Early seizures are a common complication of intracerebral hemorrhage, occurring in \textasciitilde 10\% of patients. However, the independent effect of early seizures on patient outcomes, particularly health-related quality of life, is unclear. Without a potential benefit to patient outcomes, the widespread use (\textasciitilde 40\%) of prophylactic seizure medications has no reasonable chance of improving patient outcomes. We tested the hypothesis that health-related quality of life at follow-up is different between patients with and without early seizures (and secondarily, with nonconvulsive status epilepticus) after intracerebral hemorrhage. DESIGN: Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage were enrolled in an observational cohort study that prospectively collected clinical data and health-related quality of life at follow-up. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: One-hundred thirty-three patients whose health-related quality of life was assessed 3 months after intracerebral hemorrhage onset. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Health-related quality of life was obtained at 3 months after intracerebral hemorrhage onset. T Scores of health-related quality of life were modeled with multivariable linear models accounting for severity with the intracerebral hemorrhage Score and hematoma location. Health-related quality of life was measured with National Institutes of Health Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System/Neuroquality of life, expressed in T Scores (U.S. normal 50 {$\pm$} 10). The modified Rankin Scale (a global measure) was a secondary outcome. There were 12 patients (9\%) with early seizures. T Scores of health-related quality of life at follow-up were lower (worse) in patients with early seizure compared with patients without an early seizure (44 [32.75\textendash 51.85] vs 30.25 [18.9\textendash 39.15]; p = 0.04); results for other domains of health-related quality of life were similar. The association persisted in multivariable models. There was no association between early seizures and prophylactic seizure medications (p = 0.4). Results for patients with nonconvulsive status epilepticus were similar. There was no association between early seizures and the modified Rankin Scale at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Early seizures and nonconvulsive status epilepticus were associated with lower health-related quality of life at follow-up in survivors of intracerebral hemorrhage.},

Design: An appointed Task Force followed a standard, systematic, and evidence-based approach in reviewing the literature to develop these guidelines. Measurements and Main Results: The assessment of the evidence and recommendations was based on the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. The general subject was addressed in sections: admission criteria and benefits of different levels of care, triage, discharge timing and strategies, use of outreach programs to supplement ICU care, quality assurance\&sol;improvement and metrics, nonbeneficial treatment in the ICU, and rationing considerations. The literature searches yielded 2,404 articles published from January 1998 to October 2013 for review. Following the appraisal of the literature, discussion, and consensus, recommendations were written. Conclusion: Although these are administrative guidelines, the subjects addressed encompass complex ethical and medico-legal aspects of patient care that affect daily clinical practice. A limited amount of high-quality evidence made it difficult to answer all the questions asked related to ICU admission, discharge, and triage. Despite these limitations, the members of the Task Force believe that these recommendations provide a comprehensive framework to guide practitioners in making informed decisions during the admission, discharge, and triage process as well as in resolving issues of nonbeneficial treatment and rationing. We need to further develop preventive strategies to reduce the burden of critical illness, educate our noncritical care colleagues about these interventions, and improve our outreach, developing early identification and intervention systems.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Salt substitutes with reduced sodium levels and increased potassium levels have been shown to lower blood pressure, but their effects on cardiovascular and safety outcomes are uncertain. METHODS We conducted an open-label, cluster-randomized trial involving persons from 600 villages in rural China. The participants had a history of stroke or were 60 years of age or older and had high blood pressure. The villages were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention group, in which the participants used a salt substitute (75\% sodium chloride and 25\% potassium chloride by mass), or to the control group, in which the participants continued to use regular salt (100\% sodium chloride). The primary outcome was stroke, the secondary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events and death from any cause, and the safety outcome was clinical hyperkalemia. RESULTS A total of 20,995 persons were enrolled in the trial. The mean age of the participants was 65.4 years, and 49.5\% were female, 72.6\% had a history of stroke, and 88.4\% a history of hypertension. The mean duration of follow-up was 4.74 years. The rate of stroke was lower with the salt substitute than with regular salt (29.14 events vs. 33.65 events per 1000 person-years; rate ratio, 0.86; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.77 to 0.96; P\,=\,0.006), as were the rates of major cardiovascular events (49.09 events vs. 56.29 events per 1000 person-years; rate ratio, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.80 to 0.94; P{$<$}0.001) and death (39.28 events vs. 44.61 events per 1000 person-years; rate ratio, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.82 to 0.95; P{$<$}0.001). The rate of serious adverse events attributed to hyperkalemia was not significantly higher with the salt substitute than with regular salt (3.35 events vs. 3.30 events per 1000 person-years; rate ratio, 1.04; 95\% CI, 0.80 to 1.37; P\,=\,0.76).

CSC guidelines mandate receipt of patients with ICH for higher level of care. We determined resource utilization of patients accepted from outside hospitals compared with patients directly arriving to our center.MethodsFrom our stroke registry, we compared patients with primary ICH transferred to those directly arriving to our CSC from March 2011-March 2012. We compared the proportion of patients who utilized at least one of these resources: neurointensive care unit (NICU), neurosurgical intervention, or clinical trial enrollment.ResultsAmong the 362 patients, 210 (58\%) were transfers. Transferred patients were older, had higher median Glasgow Coma Scale scores, and lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores than directly admitted patients. Transfers had smaller median ICH volumes (20.5\,cc versus 15.2\,cc; P\,=\,.04) and lower ICH scores (2.1\,{$\pm$}\,1.4 versus 1.6\,{$\pm$}\,1.3; P\,{$<$}\,.01). A smaller proportion of transfers utilized CSC-specific resources compared with direct admits (P\,=\,.02). Fewer transferred patients required neurosurgical intervention or were enrolled in trials. No significant difference was found in the proportion of patients who used NICU resources, although transferred patients had a significantly lower length of stay in the NICU. Average hospital stay costs were less for transferred patients than for direct admits.ConclusionsPatients with ICH transferred to our CSC underwent fewer neurosurgical procedures and had a shorter stay in the NICU. These results were reflected in the lower per-patient costs in the transferred group. Our results raise the need to analyze cost\textendash benefits and resource utilization of transferring patients with milder ICH.}

Participants (agreed/strongly agreed: 94\%) reported that strain was best defined as ``a time-varying imbalance between the supply of available beds, staff and/or resources and the demand to provide high-quality care for patients who may become or who are critically ill''; while some recommended defining ``high-quality care'', integrating ``safety'', and families in the definition. Participants reported significant contributors to strain were: ``inability to discharge ICU patients due to lack of available ward beds'' (97\%); ``increases in the volume'' (89\%); and ``acuity and complexity of patients requiring ICU support'' (88\%). Strain was perceived to ``increase stress levels in health care providers'' (98\%); and ``burnout in health care providers'' (96\%). The highest ranked strategies were: ``have more consistent and better goals-of-care conversations with patients/families outside of ICU'' (95\%); and ``increase non-acute care beds'' (92\%). Strain is perceived as common. HCW believe precipitants represent a mix of patient-related and operational factors. Strain is thought to have negative implications for quality of care, HCW well-being and workplace environment. Most indicated strategies ``outside'' of ICU settings were priorities for managing strain.}

  abstract = {Decades of research have repeatedly shown that people perform poorly at estimating and understanding conditional probabilities that are inherent in Bayesian reasoning problems. Yet in the medical domain, both physicians and patients make daily, life-critical judgments based on conditional probability. Although there have been a number of attempts to develop more effective ways to facilitate Bayesian reasoning, reports of these findings tend to be inconsistent and sometimes even contradictory. For instance, the reported accuracies for individuals being able to correctly estimate conditional probability range from 6\% to 62\%. In this work, we show that problem representation can significantly affect accuracies. By controlling the amount of information presented to the user, we demonstrate how text and visualization designs can increase overall accuracies to as high as 77\%. Additionally, we found that for users with high spatial ability, our designs can further improve their accuracies to as high as 100\%. By and large, our findings provide explanations for the inconsistent reports on accuracy in Bayesian reasoning tasks and show a significant improvement over existing methods. We believe that these findings can have immediate impact on risk communication in health-related fields.},

We investigated, if spot-sign positive participants benefit more from tranexamic acid versus placebo as compared to spot-sign negative participants. Methods: TICH-2 trial (Tranexamic Acid for Hyperacute Primary Intracerebral Haemorrhage) was a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial recruiting acutely hospitalized participants with intracerebral hemorrhage within 8 hours after symptom onset. Local investigators randomized participants to 2 grams of intravenous tranexamic acid or matching placebo (1:1). All participants underwent computed tomography scan on admission and on day 2 (24{$\pm$}12 hours) after randomization. In this sub group analysis, we included all participants from the main trial population with imaging allowing adjudication of spot sign status. Results: Of the 2325 TICH-2 participants, 254 (10.9\%) had imaging allowing for spot-sign adjudication. Of these participants, 64 (25.2\%) were spot-sign positive. Median (interquartile range) time from symptom onset to administration of the intervention was 225.0 (169.0 to 310.0) minutes. The adjusted percent difference in absolute day-2 hematoma volume between participants allocated to tranexamic versus placebo was 3.7\% (95\% CI, -12.8\% to 23.4\%) for spot-sign positive and 1.7\% (95\% CI, -8.4\% to 12.8\%) for spot-sign negative participants (Pheterogenity=0.85). No difference was observed in significant hematoma progression (dichotomous composite outcome) between participants allocated to tranexamic versus placebo among spot-sign positive (odds ratio, 0.85 [95\% CI, 0.29 to 2.46]) and negative (odds ratio, 0.77 [95\% CI, 0.41 to 1.45]) participants (Pheterogenity=0.88). Conclusions: Data from the TICH-2 trial do not support that admission spot sign status modifies the treatment effect of tranexamic acid versus placebo in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage. The results might have been affected by low statistical power as well as treatment delay. Registration: URL: http://www.controlled-trials.com; Unique identifier: ISRCTN93732214.},

  abstract = {Background: Since the approval of the oral factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors, there have been concerns regarding the ability to neutralize their anticoagulant effects after intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Multiple guidelines suggest using prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) in these patients based upon research that includes a limited number of patients with ICH. Given this, we aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PCC for FXa inhibitor-related ICH in a large, multicenter cohort of patients. Methods: This was a multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study of patients with apixaban or rivaroxaban-related ICH who received PCC between January 1, 2015 and March 1, 2019. The study had two primary analysis groups: safety and hemostatic efficacy. The safety analysis evaluated all patients meeting inclusion criteria for the occurrence of a thrombotic event, which were censored at hospital discharge or 30 days following PCC administration. Patients with intracerebral, subarachnoid, or subdural hemorrhages who had at least one follow-up image within 24 hours of PCC administration were assessed for hemostatic efficacy. The primary efficacy outcome was the percentage of patients with excellent or good hemostasis based upon the modified Sarode criteria. Secondary outcomes included an evaluation of in-hospital mortality, length of stay, infusion-related reactions and thrombotic event occurrence during multiple pre-defined periods. Results: A total of 663 patients were included and assessed for safety outcomes. Of these, 433 patients met criteria for hemostatic efficacy evaluation. We observed excellent or good hemostasis in 354 patients (81.8\%; 95\% confidence interval 77.9 \textendash{} 85.2). Twenty-five (3.8\%) patients had a total of 26 thrombotic events, of which 22 occurred in the first 14 days following PCC administration. One patient had documentation of an infusion-related reaction. For the full cohort of patients, in-hospital mortality was 19.0\% and the median intensive care unit and hospital length of stay were 2.0 and 6.0 days, respectively. Conclusions: Administration of PCC after apixaban and rivaroxaban-related ICH provided a high rate of excellent or good hemostasis (81.8\%) coupled with a 3.8\% thrombosis rate. Randomized, controlled trials evaluating the clinical efficacy of PCC in patients with FXa inhibitor-related ICH are needed.},

  abstract = {Background The use of warfarin reduces the rate of ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation but requires frequent monitoring and dose adjustment. Rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, may provide more consistent and predictable anticoagulation than warfarin. Methods In a double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 14,264 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who were at increased risk for stroke to receive either rivaroxaban (at a daily dose of 20 mg) or dose-adjusted warfarin. The per-protocol, as-treated primary analysis was designed to determine whether rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin for the primary end point of stroke or systemic embolism. Results In the primary analysis, the primary end point occurred in 188 patients in the rivaroxaban group (1.7\% per year) and in 241 in the warfarin group (2.2\% per year) (hazard ratio in the rivaroxaban group, 0.79; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.96; P{$<$}0.001 for noninferiority). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the primary end point occurred in 269 patients in the rivaroxaban group (2.1\% per year) and in 306 patients in the warfarin group (2.4\% per year) (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.74 to 1.03; P{$<$}0.001 for noninferiority; P\,=\,0.12 for superiority). Major and nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding occurred in 1475 patients in the rivaroxaban group (14.9\% per year) and in 1449 in the warfarin group (14.5\% per year) (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95\% CI, 0.96 to 1.11; P\,=\,0.44), with significant reductions in intracranial hemorrhage (0.5\% vs. 0.7\%, P\,=\,0.02) and fatal bleeding (0.2\% vs. 0.5\%, P\,=\,0.003) in the rivaroxaban group. Conclusions In patients with atrial fibrillation, rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. There was no significant between-group difference in the risk of major bleeding, although intracranial and fatal bleeding occurred less frequently in the rivaroxaban group.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Procalcitonin (PCT)-guided antibiotic discontinuation appears to decrease antibiotic use in critically ill patients, but its impact on survival remains less certain. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and CENTRAL for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PCT-guided antibiotic discontinuation in critically ill adults reporting survival or antibiotic duration. Searches were conducted without language restrictions from inception to July 23, 2018. Two reviewers independently conducted all review stages; another adjudicated differences. Data were pooled using random-effects metaanalysis. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and evidence was graded using GRADEpro. RESULTS: Among critically ill adults (5,158 randomized; 5,000 analyzed), PCT-guided antibiotic discontinuation was associated with decreased mortality (16 RCTs; risk ratio [RR], 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.83-0.97; I2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0\%; low certainty). Death was the primary outcome in only one study and a survival benefit was not observed in the subset specified as sepsis (10 RCTs; RR, 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.85-1.03; I2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0\%), those without industry sponsorship (nine RCTs; RR, 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.87-1.10; I2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0\%), high PCT-guided algorithm adherence (five RCTs; RR, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.711.22; I2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0\%), and PCT-guided algorithms without C-reactive protein (eight RCTs; RR, 0.96; 95\% CI, 0.87-1.06; I2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0\%). PCT-guided antibiotic discontinuation decreased antibiotic duration (mean difference, 1.31 days; 95\% CI, \textendash 2.27 to \textendash 0.35; I2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 93\%) (low certainty). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of increased survival and decreased antibiotic utilization associated with PCT-guided antibiotic discontinuation represent low-certainty evidence with a high risk of bias. This relationship was primarily observed in studies without high protocol adherence and in studies with algorithms combining PCT and C-reactive protein. Properly designed studies with mortality as the primary outcome are needed to address this question.

The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of desmopressin acetate as a therapeutic agent to avoid overcorrection of hyponatremia and to lower the plasma sodium concentration again after inadvertent overcorrection. Design, setting, participants, \& measurements: Retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients who were given desmopressin acetate during the treatment of hyponatremia during 6 yr in a 528-bed community teaching hospital. Results: Six patients (group 1) were given desmopressin acetate after the 24-h limit of 12 mmol/L had already been reached or exceeded; correction was prevented from exceeding the 48-h limit of 18 mmol/L in five of the six. Fourteen patients (group 2) were given desmopressin acetate in anticipation of overcorrection after the plasma sodium concentration had increased by 1 to 12 mmol/L. In all 14 patients who were treated with desmopressin acetate as a preventive measure, correction was prevented from exceeding either the 24- or 48-h limits. After desmopressin acetate was administered, the plasma sodium concentration of 14 of the 20 patients fell by 2 to 9 mmol/L. In all six group 1 patients and in five of the group 2 patients, the plasma sodium concentration was actively lowered again by the concurrent administration of desmopressin acetate and 5\% dextrose in water; no serious adverse consequences from this maneuver were observed. Conclusion: Desmopressin acetate is effective in preventing and reversing inadvertent overcorrection of hyponatremia. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 3: 331-336, 2008. doi: 10.2215/CJN.03190807},

  abstract = {Background: The immediate management of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients in hospitals without neurosurgical/neurointerventional facilities and their transfer to a specialized center is challenging and not well covered in existing guidelines. To address these issues, we created a consensus of experts endorsed by the Italian Society of Anesthesia and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) to provide clinical guidance. Methods: A multidisciplinary consensus panel composed by 19 physicians selected for their established clinical and scientific expertise in the acute management of SAH patients with different specializations (anesthesia/intensive care, neurosurgery and interventional neuroradiology) was created. A modified Delphi approach was adopted. Results: A total of 14 statements have been discussed. Consensus was reached on 11 strong recommendations and 2 weak recommendations. In one case, where consensus could not be agreed upon, no recommendation could be provided. Conclusions: Management of SAH in a non-specialized setting and early transfer are difficult and may have a critical impact on outcome. Clinical advice, based on multidisciplinary consensus, might be helpful. Our recommendations cover most, but not all, topics of clinical relevance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Specific reversal agents for non\textendash vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are lacking. Idarucizumab, an antibody fragment, was developed to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran. METHODS We undertook this prospective cohort study to determine the safety of 5 g of intravenous idarucizumab and its capacity to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran in patients who had serious bleeding (group A) or required an urgent procedure (group B). The primary end point was the maximum percentage reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran within 4 hours after the administration of idarucizumab, on the basis of the determination at a central laboratory of the dilute thrombin time or ecarin clotting time. A key secondary end point was the restoration of hemostasis. RESULTS This interim analysis included 90 patients who received idarucizumab (51 patients in group A and 39 in group B). Among 68 patients with an elevated dilute thrombin time and 81 with an elevated ecarin clotting time at baseline, the median maximum percentage reversal was 100\% (95\% confidence interval, 100 to 100). Idarucizumab normalized the test results in 88 to 98\% of the patients, an effect that was evident within minutes. Concentrations of unbound dabigatran remained below 20 ng per milliliter at 24 hours in 79\% of the patients. Among 35 patients in group A who could be assessed, hemostasis, as determined by local investigators, was restored at a median of 11.4 hours. Among 36 patients in group B who underwent a procedure, normal intraoperative hemostasis was reported in 33, and mildly or moderately abnormal hemostasis was reported in 2 patients and 1 patient, respectively. One thrombotic event occurred within 72 hours after idarucizumab administration in a patient in whom anticoagulants had not been reinitiated.

METHODS We randomly assigned eligible participants with intracerebral hemorrhage (volume, {$<$}60 cm3) and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 5 or more (on a scale from 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating worse condition) to a systolic blood-pressure target of 110 to 139 mm Hg (intensive treatment) or a target of 140 to 179 mm Hg (standard treatment) in order to test the superiority of intensive reduction of systolic blood pressure to standard reduction; intravenous nicardipine to lower blood pressure was administered within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. The primary outcome was death or disability (modified Rankin scale score of 4 to 6, on a scale ranging from 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) at 3 months after randomization, as ascertained by an investigator who was unaware of the treatment assignments. RESULTS Among 1000 participants with a mean ({$\pm$}SD) systolic blood pressure of 200.6{$\pm$}27.0 mm Hg at baseline, 500 were assigned to intensive treatment and 500 to standard treatment. The mean age of the patients was 61.9 years, and 56.2\% were Asian. Enrollment was stopped because of futility after a prespecified interim analysis. The primary outcome of death or disability was observed in 38.7\% of the participants (186 of 481) in the intensive-treatment group and in 37.7\% (181 of 480) in the standard-treatment group (relative risk, 1.04; 95\% confidence interval, 0.85 to 1.27; analysis was adjusted for age, initial GCS score, and presence or absence of intraventricular hemorrhage). Serious adverse events occurring within 72 hours after randomization that were considered by the site investigator to be related to treatment were reported in 1.6\% of the patients in the intensive-treatment group and in 1.2\% of those in the standard-treatment group. The rate of renal adverse events within 7 days after randomization was significantly higher in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group (9.0\% vs. 4.0\%, P\,=\,0.002).

  abstract = {Background: Researchers often misinterpret and misrepresent statistical outputs. This abuse has led to a large literature on modification or replacement of testing thresholds and P-values with confidence intervals, Bayes factors, and other devices. Because the core problems appear cognitive rather than statistical, we review some simple methods to aid researchers in interpreting statistical outputs. These methods emphasize logical and information concepts over probability, and thus may be more robust to common misinterpretations than are traditional descriptions. Methods: We use the Shannon transform of the P-value p, also known as the binary surprisal or S-value s = -log2(p), to provide a measure of the information supplied by the testing procedure, and to help calibrate intuitions against simple physical experiments like coin tossing. We also use tables or graphs of test statistics for alternative hypotheses, and interval estimates for different percentile levels, to thwart fallacies arising from arbitrary dichotomies. Finally, we reinterpret P-values and interval estimates in unconditional terms, which describe compatibility of data with the entire set of analysis assumptions. We illustrate these methods with a reanalysis of data from an existing record-based cohort study. Conclusions: In line with other recent recommendations, we advise that teaching materials and research reports discuss P-values as measures of compatibility rather than significance, compute P-values for alternative hypotheses whenever they are computed for null hypotheses, and interpret interval estimates as showing values of high compatibility with data, rather than regions of confidence. Our recommendations emphasize cognitive devices for displaying the compatibility of the observed data with various hypotheses of interest, rather than focusing on single hypothesis tests or interval estimates. We believe these simple reforms are well worth the minor effort they require.},

  abstract = {Neurocritical care has advanced substantially in recent decades, allowing doctors to treat patients with more com-plicated conditions who require a multidisciplinary approach to achieve better clinical outcomes. In neurocritical patients, nonneurological complications such as acute kidney injury (AKI) are independent predictors of worse clinical outcomes. Different research groups have reported an AKI incidence of 11.6\% and an incidence of stage 3 AKI, accord-ing to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes, that requires dialysis of 3\% to 12\% in neurocritical patients. These patients tend to be younger, have less comorbidity, and have a different risk profile, given the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures they undergo. Trauma-induced AKI, sepsis, sympathetic overstimulation, tubular epitheliopa-thy, hyperchloremia, use of nephrotoxic drugs, and renal hypoperfusion are some of the causes of AKI in neurocritical patients. AKI is the result of a sum of events, although the mechanisms underlying many of them remain uncertain; however, two important causes that merit mention are direct alteration of the physiological brain\textendash kidney connection and exposure to injury as a result of the specific medical management and well-established therapies that neurocriti-cal patients are subjected to. This review will focus on AKI in neurocritical care patients. Specifically, it will discuss its epidemiology, causes, associated mechanisms, and relationship to the brain\textendash kidney axis. Additionally, the use and risks of extracorporeal therapies in this group of patients will be reviewed.},

  abstract = {Etiological research aims to uncover causal effects, whilst prediction research aims to forecast an outcome with the best accuracy. Causal and prediction research usually require different methods, and yet their findings may get conflated when reported and interpreted. The aim of the current study is to quantify the frequency of conflation between etiological and prediction research, to discuss common underlying mistakes and provide recommendations on how to avoid these. Observational cohort studies published in January 2018 in the top-ranked journals of six distinct medical fields (Cardiology, Clinical Epidemiology, Clinical Neurology, General and Internal Medicine, Nephrology and Surgery) were included for the current scoping review. Data on conflation was extracted through signaling questions. In total, 180 studies were included. Overall, 26\% (n\,=\,46) contained conflation between etiology and prediction. The frequency of conflation varied across medical field and journal impact factor. From the causal studies 22\% was conflated, mainly due to the selection of covariates based on their ability to predict without taking the causal structure into account. Within prediction studies 38\% was conflated, the most frequent reason was a causal interpretation of covariates included in a prediction model. Conflation of etiology and prediction is a common methodological error in observational medical research and more frequent in prediction studies. As this may lead to biased estimations and erroneous conclusions, researchers must be careful when designing, interpreting and disseminating their research to ensure this conflation is avoided.},

  abstract = {Background: A meta-analysis concerning perioperative coagulation competence, hemorrhage, and outcome was conducted including the use of hydroxyethyl starches (HESs), dextran, or albumin versus administration of a crystalloid as control to assess the efficacy and safety of colloids and crystalloids for fluid administration during major elective surgery. Surgery was restricted to cardiovascular and noncardiovascular surgery, and HESs were stratified to HES 130/0.4 and HES 200/0.5. Methods: We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, EMBASE, conference proceedings, reference lists, and databases of ongoing trials. Results: Thirty one primary clinical randomized controlled trials included 2287 patients undergoing major surgery from January 2000 to August 2015. The perioperative changes in coagulation competence were measured by thromboelastography (TEG) maximum amplitude (MA) in 9 studies administering crystalloids versus HES and in 4 studies administering albumin versus HES. All studies but 1 disclosed increased reduction in TEG-MA following HES administration (P = 0.0001 and 0.0002). The total loss of blood was reported in 17 studies in which crystalloids were compared to HES and 12 studies reported increased blood loss after administration of HES (P {$<$} 0.003). When administering albumin versus HES, 6 studies reported reduced hemorrhage associated with albumin administration (P = 0.005). Reoperation was not significantly reduced by the use of crystalloids, but may be more frequent after HESs compared to albumin (P {$<$} 0.03). In this analysis, more patients admitted to administration of HESs were exposed to decrease coagulation competence, compared to perioperative crystalloids and albumin administration. Conclusion: This stratified meta-analysis showed that increased blood loss was found in noncardiovascular surgery among patients receiving HES compared with crystalloids, followed by a marked reduction in TEG-MA, and infusion of 3rd-generation HES products did not influence the results significantly.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological studies consistently show that prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) increases with ageing. Nonetheless, complaints of ED even in younger men are becoming more and more frequent. Healthcare professionals working in Sexual Medicine but even those operating in different clinical contexts might be adequately prepared to answer this increasing requirement. ED in younger men is likely to be overlooked and dismissed without performing any medical assessment, even the most basic ones, such as collection of medical history and physical exam. This is due to the widespread assumption that ED in younger individuals is a self-limiting condition, which does not deserve any clinical evaluation or therapy and can be managed only with patient reassurance. However, evidence shows that, in younger subjects, organic, psychological and relational conditions can contribute to the pathogenesis of ED and all these conditions might be evaluated and treated, whenever necessary. Among the organic conditions contributing to the onset of ED, metabolic and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors are surprisingly of particular relevance in this age group. In fact, in younger men with ED, even more than in older ones, recognizing CV risk factors or conditions suggestive of cardio-metabolic derangements can help identifying men who, although at low absolute risk due to young age, carry a high relative risk for development of CV events. In this view, the assessment of a possible organic component of ED even in younger individuals acquires a pivotal importance, because it offers the unique opportunity to unearth the presence of CV risk factors, thus allowing effective and high quality preventive interventions.},

The aim was to analyse the quality of evidence supporting recommendations on the management of sepsis. Methods: The strength and quality of evidence (high, moderate, low-very low and best practice statements) of each recommendation were extracted. Randomised controlled trials were required to qualify as high-quality evidence. Results: A total of 96 recommendations were formulated, and 87 were included. Among thirty-one (43\%) strong recommendations, only 15.2\% were supported by high-quality evidence. Overall, thirty-seven (42.5\%) recommendations were based on low-quality evidence, followed by 28 (32.2\%) based on moderate-quality, 15 (17.2\%) were best practice statements and only seven (8.0\%) were supported by high-quality evidence. Randomised controlled trials supported 21.4\%, 9.5\% and 8.6\% recommendations on mechanical ventilation, resuscitation, and management/adjuvant therapy, respectively. In contrast, none high-quality evidence recommendation supported antimicrobial/source control (82.4\% were lowvery low evidence or best practice statements), and nutrition. Conclusions: In the SSC guidelines most recommendations were informed by indirect evidence and nonsystematic observations. While awaiting trials results, Delphi-like approaches or multi-criteria decision analyses should guide recommendations.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To explore the effect of DTAS on clinical outcomes among patients with LVO stroke in a randomized clinical trial. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The study was an investigator-initiated, single-center, evaluator-blinded randomized clinical trial. Of 466 consecutive patients with acute stroke screened, 174 with suspected LVO acute stroke within 6 hours of symptom onset were included. Enrollment took place from September 2018 to November 2020 and was stopped after a preplanned interim analysis. Final follow-up was in February 2021. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to follow either DTAS (89 patients) or conventional workflow (85 patients received direct transfer to computed tomographic imaging, with usual imaging performed and EVT indication decided) to assess the indication of EVT. Patients were stratified according to their having been transferred from a primary center vs having a direct admission. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was a shift analysis assessing the distribution of the 90-day 7-category (from 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score among patients with LVO whether or not they received EVT (modified intention-to-treat population) assessed by blinded external evaluators. Secondary outcomes included rate of EVT and door-to-arterial puncture time. Safety outcomes included 90-day mortality and rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS In total, 174 patients were included, with a mean (SD) age of 73.4 (12.6) years (range, 19-95 years), and 78 patients (44.8\%) were women. Their mean (SD) onset-to-door time was 228.0 (117.9) minutes, and their median admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 18 (interquartile range [IQR], 14-21). In the modified intention-to-treat population, EVT was performed for all 74 patients in the DTAS group and for 64 patients (87.7\%) in the conventional workflow group (P = .002). The DTAS protocol decreased the median door\textendash to\textendash arterial puncture time (18 minutes [IQR, 15-24 minutes] vs 42 minutes [IQR, 35-51 minutes]; P {$<$} .001) and door-to-reperfusion time (57 minutes [IQR, 43-77 minutes] vs 84 minutes [IQR, 63-117 minutes]; P {$<$} .001). The DTAS protocol decreased the severity of disability across the range of the mRS (adjusted common odds ratio, 2.2; 95\% CI, 1.2-4.1; P = .009). Safety variables were comparable between groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE For patients with LVO admitted within 6 hours after symptom onset, this randomized clinical trial found that, compared with conventional workflow, the use of DTAS increased the odds of patients undergoing EVT, decreased hospital workflow time, and improved clinical outcome.},

  abstract = {Strained intensive care unit (ICU) capacity represents a fundamental supply-demand mismatch in ICU resources. Strain is likely to be influenced by a range of factors; however, there has been no systematic evaluation of the spectrum of measures that may indicate strain on ICU capacity. We performed a systematic review to identify indicators of strained capacity. A comprehensive peer-reviewed search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science Core Collection was performed along with selected grey literature sources. We included studies published in English after 1990. We included studies that: (1) focused on ICU settings; (2) included description of a quality or performance measure; and (3) described strained capacity. Retrieved studies were screened, selected and extracted in duplicate. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS). Analysis was descriptive. Of 5297 studies identified in our search; 51 fulfilled eligibility. Most were cohort studies (n = 39; 76.5\%), five (9.8\%) were case-control, three (5.8\%) were cross-sectional, two (3.9\%) were modeling studies, one (2\%) was a correlational study, and one (2\%) was a quality improvement project. Most observational studies were high quality. Sixteen measures designed to indicate strain were identified 110 times, and classified as structure (n = 4, 25\%), process (n = 7, 44\%) and outcome (n = 5, 31\%) indicators, respectively. The most commonly identified indicators of strain were ICU acuity (n = 21; 19.1\% [process]), ICU readmission (n = 18; 16.4\% [outcome]), after-hours discharge (n = 15; 13.6\% [process]) and ICU census (n = 13; 11.8\% [structure]). There was substantial heterogeneity in the operational definitions used to define strain indicators across studies. We identified and characterized 16 indicators of strained ICU capacity across the spectrum of healthcare quality domains. Future work should aim to evaluate their implementation into practice and assess their value for evaluating strategies to mitigate strain. This systematic review was registered at PROSPERO (March 27, 2015; CRD42015017931).}

We aimed to explore differences in outcome associated with delirium resolution before hospital discharge, as well as the potential mediating role of postacute discharge site. METHODS: We performed a single-center cohort study on consecutive ICH patients over 2 years. Delirium was diagnosed according to DSM-5 criteria and further classified as persistent or resolved based on delirium status at hospital discharge. We determined the impact of delirium on unfavorable 3-month outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 4\textendash 6) using logistic regression models adjusted for established ICH predictors, then used mediation analysis to examine the indirect effect of delirium via postacute discharge site. RESULTS: Of 590 patients (mean age 70.5{$\pm$}15.5 years, 52\% male, 83\% White), 59\% (n=348) developed delirium during hospitalization. Older age and higher ICH severity were delirium risk factors, but only younger age predicted delirium resolution, which occurred in 75\% (161/215) of ICH survivors who had delirium. Delirium was strongly associated with unfavorable outcome, but patients with persistent delirium fared worse (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 7.3 [95\% CI, 3.3\textendash 16.3]) than those whose delirium resolved (adjusted OR, 3.1 [95\% CI, 1.8\textendash 5.5]). Patients with delirium were less likely to be discharged to inpatient rehabilitation than skilled nursing facilities (adjusted OR, 0.31 [95\% CI, 0.17\textendash 0.59]), and postacute care site partially mediated the relationship between delirium and functional outcome in ICH survivors, leading to a 25\% reduction in the effect of delirium (without mediator: adjusted OR, 3.0 [95\% CI, 1.7\textendash 5.6]; with mediator: adjusted OR, 2.3 [95\% CI, 1.2\textendash 4.3]). CONCLUSIONS: Acute delirium resolves in most patients with ICH by hospital discharge, which was associated with better outcomes than in patients with persistent delirium. The impact of delirium on outcomes may be further mitigated by postacute rehabilitation.},

Methods:\hspace{0.6em} This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial included patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring\,{$>$}\,6 L/min supplemental oxygen. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to receive tocilizumab 8 mg/kg or placebo intravenously plus\,{$\leq$}\,10 days of remdesivir. The primary outcome was time from randomization to hospital discharge or ``ready for discharge'' (defined as category 1, assessed by the investigator on a 7-category ordinal scale of clinical status) to day 28. Patients were followed for 60 days. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Among 649 enrolled patients, 434 were randomly assigned to tocilizumab plus remdesivir and 215 to pla-cebo plus remdesivir. 566 patients (88.2\%) received corticosteroids during the trial to day 28. Median time from rand-omization to hospital discharge or ``ready for discharge'' was 14 (95\% CI 12\textendash 15) days with tocilizumab plus remdesivir and 14 (95\% CI 11\textendash 16) days with placebo plus remdesivir [log-rank P\,=\,0.74; Cox proportional hazards ratio 0.97 (95\% CI 0.78\textendash 1.19)].

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most fatal and disabling stroke subtype. Widely used tools for prediction of mortality are fundamentally limited in that they do not account for effects of withdrawal of care and are not designed to predict functional recovery. We developed an acute clinical score to predict likelihood of functional independence. Methods\textemdash We prospectively characterized 629 consecutive patients with ICH at hospital presentation. Predictors of functional independence (Glasgow Outcome Score Ն4) at 90 days were used to develop a logistic regression-based risk stratification scale in a random subset of two thirds and validated in the remaining one third of the cohort. Results\textemdash At 90 days, 162 (26\%) patients achieved independence. Age, Glasgow Coma Scale, ICH location, volume (all PϽ0.0001), and pre-ICH cognitive impairment (Pϭ0.005) were independently associated with Glasgow Outcome Score Ն4. The FUNC score was developed as a sum of individual points (0 \textendash 11) based on strength of association with outcome. In both the development and validation cohorts, the proportion of patients who achieved Glasgow Outcome Score Ն4 increased steadily with FUNC score. No patient assigned a FUNC score Յ4 achieved functional independence, whereas Ͼ80\% with a score of 11 did. The predictive accuracy of the FUNC score remained unchanged when restricted to ICH survivors only, consistent with absence of confounding by early withdrawal of care. Conclusions\textemdash FUNC score is a valid clinical assessment tool that identifies patients with ICH who will attain functional independence and thus, can provide guidance in clinical decision-making and patient selection for clinical trials.

We have evaluated the antihypertensive effect of bedtime administration of aspirin in patients with cardiovascular disease already treated for hypertension. Methods: This is a multicenter randomized triple-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial, with hypertensive patients treated with aspirin for secondary prevention. There was a baseline-randomized assignment to 2-month periods of bedtime aspirin (100 mg) first and morning-time aspirin later, or inversely, both periods separated by an open label 2\textendash 4 weeks period of morning-time aspirin. At the start and end of each treatment period, a 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed. The main outcome measure was mean 24-h blood pressure. The analyses were performed according to the intentionto-treat principle. Results: Overall, 225 patients were randomized. No significant differences were observed in ambulatory blood pressure by time of intake of usual low doses of aspirin. The mean SBP/DBP was 123.2/69.9 (95\% CI 121.58\textendash 124.9/68.86\textendash 76.86) with bedtime administration and 122.4/68.8 (95\% CI 120.76\textendash 124.01/67.85\textendash 69.83) with daytime administration (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.3 and P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.23 for SBP and DBP, respectively). Conclusion: Administering aspirin at bedtime rather than in the morning does not modify the 24-h ambulatory blood pressure in hypertensive patients in secondary cardiovascular prevention. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01741922).},

Objectives:\hspace{0.6em} The objectives are to review safety and efficacy of vasopressors, pathophysiology, agents that decrease vasopressor dose, predictive biomarkers, {$\beta$}1-blockers, and directions for research. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} The quality of evidence was evaluated using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). Results:\hspace{0.6em} Vasopressors bind adrenergic: {$\alpha$}1, {$\alpha$}2, {$\beta$}1, {$\beta$}2; vasopressin: AVPR1a, AVPR1B, AVPR2; angiotensin II: AG1, AG2; and dopamine: DA1, DA2 receptors inducing vasoconstriction. Vasopressor choice and dose vary because of patients and physician practice. Adverse effects include excessive vasoconstriction, organ ischemia, hyperglycemia, hyperlactatemia, tachycardia, and tachyarrhythmias. No randomized controlled trials of vasopressors showed a significant difference in 28-day mortality rate. Norepinephrine is the first-choice vasopressor in vasodilatory shock after adequate volume resuscitation. Some strategies that decrease norepinephrine dose (vasopressin, angiotensin II) have not decreased 28-day mortality while corticosteroids have decreased 28-day mortality significantly in some (two large trials) but not all trials. In norepinephrine-refractory patients, vasopressin or epinephrine may be added. A new vasopressor, angiotensin II, may be useful in profoundly hypotensive patients. Dobutamine may be added because vasopressors may decrease ventricular contractility. Dopamine is recommended only in bradycardic patients. There are potent vasopressors with limited evidence (e.g. methylene blue, metaraminol) and novel vasopressors in development (selepressin). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Norepinephrine is first choice followed by vasopressin or epinephrine. Angiotensin II and dopamine have limited indications. In future, predictive biomarkers may guide vasopressor selection and novel vasopressors may emerge.},

  abstract = {Objective\hspace{0.6em} The traditional approach of null hypothesis testing dominates the design and analysis of randomised controlled trials. This study aimed to demonstrate how a simple Bayesian analysis could have been used to analyse the Optimisation of Perioperative Cardiovascular Management to Improve Surgical Outcome (OPTIMISE) trial to obtain more clinically interpretable results. Design, setting, participants and interventions\hspace{0.6em}The OPTIMISE trial was a pragmatic, multicentre, observerblinded, randomised controlled trial of 734 high-risk patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery in 17 acute care hospitals in the UK. Patients were randomly allocated to a cardiac output-guided haemodynamic therapy algorithm for intravenous fluid and inotropic drug administration during and in the 6\,hours following surgery (n=368) or to standard care (n=366). The primary outcome was a binary outcome consisting of a composite of predefined 30-day moderate or major complications and mortality. Methods\hspace{0.6em} We repeated the primary outcome analysis of the OPTIMISE trial using Bayesian statistical methods to calculate the probability that the intervention was superior, and the probability that a clinically relevant difference existed. We explored the impact of a flat prior and an evidence-based prior on our analyses. Results\hspace{0.6em} Although OPTIMISE was not powered to detect a statistically significant difference between the treatment arms for the observed effect size (relative risk=0.84, 95\%\,CI 0.70 to 1.01; p=0.07), by using Bayesian analyses we were able to demonstrate that there was a 96.9\% (flat prior) to 99.5\% (evidence-based prior) probability that the intervention was superior to the control. Conclusions\hspace{0.6em} The use of a Bayesian analytical approach provided a different interpretation of the findings of the OPTIMISE trial (compared with the original frequentist analysis), and suggested patient benefit from the intervention. Incorporation of information from previous studies provided further evidence of a benefit from the intervention. Bayesian analyses can produce results that are more easily interpretable and relevant to clinicians and policy-makers. Trial registration number\hspace{0.6em} ISRCTN04386758; Postresults.},

DESIGN: Retrospective, observational study using segmented and multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the associations of catecholamine dose, lactate concentration, and timing from shock onset at vasopressin initiation with in-hospital mortality. SETTING: Multiple hospitals within the Cleveland Clinic Health System. PATIENTS: Adult patients who met criteria for septic shock based on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Adult Sepsis Event definition. INTERVENTIONS: All patients received continuous infusion vasopressin as an adjunct to catecholamine vasopressors. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In total, 1,610 patients were included with a mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III 109.0 {$\pm$} 35.1 and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 14.0 {$\pm$} 3.5; 41\% of patients survived the hospital admission. At the time of vasopressin initiation, patients had median (interquartile range) lactate concentration 3.9 mmol/L (2.3\textendash 7.2 mmol/L), norepinephrine-equivalent dose 25 \textmu g/min (18\textendash 40 \textmu g/min), and 5.3 hours (2.1\textendash 12.2\,hr) elapsed since shock onset. The odds of in-hospital mortality increased 20.7\% for every 10 \textmu g/min increase in norepinephrine-equivalent dose up to 60 \textmu g/min at the time of vasopressin initiation (adjusted odds ratio, 1.21 [95\% CI, 1.09\textendash 1.34]), but no association was detected when the norepinephrine-equivalent dose exceeded 60 \textmu g/min (adjusted odds ratio, 0.96 [95\% CI, 0.84\textendash 1.10]). There was a significant interaction between timing of vasopressin initiation and lactate concentration (p = 0.02) for the association with in-hospital mortality. A linear association between increasing in-hospital mortality was detected for increasing lactate concentration at the time of vasopressin initiation, but no association was detected for time elapsed from shock onset. CONCLUSIONS: Higher norepinephrine-equivalent dose at vasopressin initiation and higher lactate concentration at vasopressin initiation were each associated higher in-hospital mortality in patients with septic shock who received vasopressin.},

  abstract = {Background: Posterior circulation and anterior circulation strokes share many clinical, pathogenetic and radiological features, although some clinical signs are highly specific to posterior circulation strokes. Arterial stenosis and occlusions occur in significant numbers in both acute posterior circulation and anterior circulation strokes, making them good candidates for endovascular treatment. Among posterior circulation strokes, basilar artery occlusions stand out because of the diagnostic and acute treatment challenges. Methods: We reviewed the literature on clinical stroke syndromes and neuroimaging findings and systematically describe for each anatomical site of stroke the detailed clinical and radiological information (anatomical representation, diffusion weighted imaging and angiographic sequences). The principles of neuroimaging of posterior circulation strokes and the prognosis for each stroke localization are also discussed. Review summary: Stroke syndromes in the territories of the vertebral, basilar, cerebellar, and posterior cerebral arteries are presented. Features typical of posterior circulation strokes are highlighted, including patterns of basilar artery occlusions. Clinical severity and prognosis of posterior circulation strokes are highly variable, and given that they are more difficult to detect on CT-based neuroimaging, magnetic resonance imaging is the technique of choice in suspected posterior circulation strokes. Rapid identification of arterial occlusion patterns may provide prognostic information and support acute revascularization decisions. Conclusions: Posterior circulation stroke syndromes tightly reflect lesion localization and arterial occlusion patterns. Although many clinical and pathogenetic features are similar to anterior circulation strokes, notable differences exist in terms of clinical presentation, stroke mechanism, prognosis, and response to acute recanalization.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hematoma volume and impaired level of consciousness are the most potent predictors of outcome after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The effect of preceding aspirin-use on outcome after ICH is poorly investigated. We investigated short-term mortality and hematoma enlargement in subjects with ICH to find the predictors for these outcomes. METHODS: This population-based study included all subjects with ICH during a period of 33 months in the population of Northern Ostrobothnia, Finland. The subjects were identified, and their clinical characteristics and outcomes were checked from hospital records or death records. RESULTS: Three-month mortality of the 208 identified subjects with ICH was 33\%. The independent risk factors for death were regular aspirin-use at the onset of ICH (relative risks [RR], 2.5; 95\% CI, 1.3 to 4.6; P=0.004), warfarin-use at the onset of ICH (RR, 3.2; 95\% CI, 1.6 to 6.1; P=0.001), and ICH score higher than 2 on admission (RR, 13.8; 95\% CI, 6.0 to 31.4; P{$<$}0.001). Regular aspirin-use preceding the onset of ICH associated significantly with hematoma enlargement during the first week after ICH (P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: We observed poor short-term outcomes and increased mortality, probably attributable to rapid enlargement of hematomas, in the subjects with ICH who had been taking regularly moderate doses of aspirin (median 250 mg) immediately before the onset of the stroke.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Optimal blood pressure (BP) management in the acute phase of ischemic stroke remains an unresolved issue. It is uncertain whether guidelines for BP management during and after intravenous alteplase can be extrapolated to endovascular treatment (EVT) for stroke due to large artery occlusion in the anterior circulation. We evaluated the associations between systolic BP (SBP) in the first 6 hours following EVT and functional outcome as well as symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. METHODS: Patients of 8 MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands) Registry centers, with available data on SBP in the 6 hours following EVT, were analyzed. We evaluated maximum, minimum, and mean SBP. Study outcomes were functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale) at 90 days and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. We used multivariable ordinal and binary regression analysis to adjust for important prognostic factors and studied possible effect modification by successful reperfusion. RESULTS: Post-EVT SBP data were available for 1161/1796 patients. Higher maximum SBP (per 10 mm\,Hg increments) was associated with worse functional outcome (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.93 [95\% CI, 0.88\textendash 0.98]) and a higher rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio, 1.17 [95\% CI, 1.02\textendash 1.36]). The association between minimum SBP and functional outcome was nonlinear with an inflection point at 124 mm\,Hg. Minimum SBP lower and higher than the inflection point were associated with worse functional outcomes (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.85 per 10 mm\,Hg decrements [95\% CI, 0.76\textendash 0.95] and adjusted common odds ratio, 0.81 per 10 mm\,Hg increments [95\% CI, 0.71\textendash 0.92]). No association between mean SBP and functional outcome was observed. Successful reperfusion did not modify the relation of SBP with any of the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Maximum SBP in the first 6 hours following EVT is positively associated with worse functional outcome and an increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Both lower and higher minimum SBP are associated with worse outcomes. A randomized trial to evaluate whether modifying post-intervention SBP results in better outcomes after EVT for ischemic stroke seems justified.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multicenter cohort study was conducted in 34 ICUs in France from 2007 to 2019 and recruited all patients who received a clinical diagnosis of encephalitis and exhibited cerebrospinal fluid positivity for herpes simplex virus DNA in the polymerase chain reaction analysis. Data analysis was performed from January to April 2020. EXPOSURES All patients underwent a standard brain MRI during the first 30 days after ICU admission. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES MRI acquisitions were analyzed by radiologists blinded to patients' outcomes, using a predefined score. Multivariable logistic regression and supervised hierarchical classifiers methods were used to identify factors associated with poor outcome at 90 days, defined by a score of 3 to 6 (indicating moderate-to-severe disability or death) on the Modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS Overall, 138 patients (median [interquartile range \{IQR\}] age, 62.6 [54.0-72.0] years; 75 men [54.3\%]) with an admission median (IQR) Glasgow Coma Scale score of 9 (6-12) were studied. The median (IQR) delay between ICU admission and MRI was 1 (1-7) days. At 90 days, 95 patients (68.8\%) had a poor outcome, including 16 deaths (11.6\%). The presence of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI signal abnormalities in more than 3 brain lobes (odds ratio [OR], 25.71; 95\% CI, 1.21-554.42), age older than 60 years (OR, 7.62; 95\% CI, 2.02-28.91), and the presence of diffusionweighted MRI signal abnormalities in the left thalamus (OR, 6.90; 95\% CI, 1.12-43.00) were independently associated with poor outcome. Machine learning models identified bilateral diffusion abnormalities as an additional factor associated with poor outcome (34 of 39 patients [87.2\%] with bilateral abnormalities had poor outcomes) and confirmed the functional burden of left thalamic lesions, particularly in older patients (all 11 patients aged {$>$}60 years had left thalamic lesions). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that in adult patients with HSE requiring ICU admission, extensive MRI changes in the brain are independently associated with poor functional},

DESIGN: This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. We searched EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and MEDLINE for randomized controlled trials that met inclusion criteria. The protocol was registered at the University hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000040528). All analyses were presented with the use of random-effects models. The primary outcome was short-term mortality defined as 28-day, 30-day, or in-hospital mortality. PATIENTS: Two authors independently evaluated the following eligibility criteria: 1) randomized controlled trial, 2) patients with sepsis aged {$\geq$}18 years, and 3) received intravenous high-dose vitamin C in addition to standard of care, or standard of care alone. Then, two authors independently extracted the selected patient and study characteristics and outcomes from studies that met above eligibility criteria. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Eleven randomized controlled trials (n = 1,737 patients) were included in this meta-analysis. High-dose IV vitamin C was not associated with a significantly lower short-term mortality (risk ratio, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.73\textendash 1.06; p = 0.18; I2 = 29\%) but was associated with a significantly shorter duration of vasopressor use (standardized mean difference, \textendash 0.35; 95\% CI, \textendash 0.63 to \textendash 0.07; p {$<$} 0.01; I2 = 80\%) and a significantly greater decline in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at 72\textendash 96 hours (standardized mean difference, \textendash 0.20; 95\% CI, \textendash 0.32 to \textendash 0.08; p {$<$} 0.01; I2 = 16\%). One study reported significant association with hypernatremia, but adverse effects were rare, and high-dose vitamin C is deemed relatively safe. CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis, the use of IV high-dose vitamin C in patients with sepsis was not associated with lower short-term mortality although it was associated with significantly shorter duration of vasopressor use and greater decline in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at 72\textendash 96 hours.},

  abstract = {DAMPs are integral in the early coordination of the innate immune system in a variety of acute illnesses. Specifically, they convey danger to other cells, trigger inflammation, and activate the innate immune system to stop further damage. DAMPs also organize tissue healing and participate in communication to inform the appropriate adaptive immune response (14, 54). The knowledge the immune system responds similarly to traumatic, ischemic, and pathogen-associated threats offers great insight into the clinical characteristics of the patients seen under our care. This is indeed an attractive theory that both share the same pathway. It is also clear that controlled release and activation of the immune system is needed to appropriately respond to danger. These responses are designed to clear damaged cells and to stop potential invasion of pathogens through lost barrier integrity (5, 14, 53). The overwhelming, exuberant, and dysregulated response could be modified for clinical benefit (97). However, even with our rudimentary understanding of DAMP release and immune activation the task is daunting. Multiple DAMPs are released with cell death and in turn activate many receptors with redundant pathways leading to immune coordination. Several trials that have blocked the best studied PAMP/TLR interaction (lipopolysaccharide and TLR4) have been unsuccessful in modifying further cytokine release or improving patient-centered outcomes (98, 99). Under normal conditions, most molecules that can act as DAMPs exist in the organism and are essential for its continued survival. Therefore, a key aspect of futures studies will be targeting these molecules specifically in their role as DAMPs but without hindering their normal role in the body. In the near term, it is not clear who could benefit from modulation of these responses in the acute setting. Indiscriminant blocking of the immune response with our current understanding of the basic science is unlikely to help patients (100, 101).},

We present four methods which are intuitively appealing, easy to implement, and combine bootstrap estimation with multiple imputation. We show that three of the four approaches yield valid inference, but that the performance of the methods varies with respect to the number of imputed data sets and the extent of missingness. Simulation studies reveal the behavior of our approaches in finite samples. A topical analysis from HIV treatment research, which determines the optimal timing of antiretroviral treatment initiation in young children, demonstrates the practical implications of the four methods in a sophisticated and realistic setting. This analysis suffers from missing data and uses the \$g\$-formula for inference, a method for which no standard errors are available.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Both balanced crystalloids and saline are used for intravenous fluid administration in critically ill adults, but it is not known which results in better clinical outcomes. METHODS In a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial conducted in five intensive care units at an academic center, we assigned 15,802 adults to receive saline (0.9\% sodium chloride) or balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte A) according to the randomization of the unit to which they were admitted. The primary outcome was a major adverse kidney event within 30 days \textemdash{} a composite of death from any cause, new renal-replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (defined as an elevation of the creatinine level to {$\geq$}200\% of baseline) \textemdash{} all censored at hospital discharge or 30 days, whichever occurred first. RESULTS Among the 7942 patients in the balanced-crystalloids group, 1139 (14.3\%) had a major adverse kidney event, as compared with 1211 of 7860 patients (15.4\%) in the saline group (marginal odds ratio, 0.91; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 0.99; conditional odds ratio, 0.90; 95\% CI, 0.82 to 0.99; P\,=\,0.04). In-hospital mortality at 30 days was 10.3\% in the balanced-crystalloids group and 11.1\% in the saline group (P\,=\,0.06). The incidence of new renal-replacement therapy was 2.5\% and 2.9\%, respectively (P\,=\,0.08), and the incidence of persistent renal dysfunction was 6.4\% and 6.6\%, respectively (P\,=\,0.60).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of endovascular therapy (EVT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke who have large vessel occlusion has rapidly increased in the United States following pivotal trials demonstrating its benefit. Information about the contribution of interhospital transfer in improving access to EVT will help organize regional systems of stroke care. METHODS: We analyzed trends of transfer-in EVT from a cohort of 1\,863\,693 patients with ischemic stroke admitted to 2143 Get With The GuidelinesStroke participating hospitals between January 2012 and December 2017. We further examined the association between arrival mode and in-hospital outcomes by using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: Of the 37\,260 patients who received EVT at 639 hospitals during the study period, 42.9\% (15\,975) arrived at the EVT-providing hospital after interhospital transfer. Transfer-in EVT cases increased from 256 in the first quarter 2012 to 1422 in the fourth quarter 2017, with sharply accelerated increases following the fourth quarter 2014 (P{$<$}0.001 for change in linear trend). Transfer-in patients were younger and more likely to be of white race, to arrive during off-hours, and to be treated at comprehensive stroke centers. Transfer-in patients had significantly longer last-known-well-to-EVT initiation time (median, 289 minutes versus 213 minutes; absolute standardized difference, 67.33) but were more likely to have door-to-EVT initiation time of {$\leq$}90 minutes (65.6\% versus 23.6\%; absolute standardized difference, 93.18). In-hospital outcomes were worse for transfer-in patients undergoing EVT in unadjusted and in risk-adjusted models. Although the difference in in-hospital mortality disappeared after adjusting for delay in EVT initiation (14.7\% versus 13.4\%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.01; 95\% CI, 0.92\textendash 1.11), transfer-in patients were still more likely to develop symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (7.0\% versus 5.7\%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.15; 95\% CI, 1.02\textendash 1.29) and less likely to have either independent ambulation at discharge (33.1\% versus 37.1\%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.80\textendash 0.95) or to be discharged to home (24.3\% versus 29.1\%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.76\textendash 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Interhospital transfer for EVT is increasingly common and is associated with a significant delay in EVT initiation highlighting the need to develop more efficient stroke systems of care. Further evaluation to identify factors that impact EVT outcomes for transfer-in patients is warranted.},

Additionally, much of this research only speculates on variable associations, leaving prospective randomized clinical trials as the sole purveyors of claims about causal relations between variables. There has been a growing movement of causal inference that uses new techniques to investigate causality using observational data. These techniques include the implementation of directed acyclic graphs, which allow researchers to explicitly and reproducibly define the causal relationships between study variables, thus making statistical analysis more robust. Directed acyclic graphs further allow researchers to identify confounding and other sources of bias and to discover causal effects among complex networks of variables. This review aims to introduce these techniques to the general urology and urologic oncology research communities in order to provide a basic understanding of causal inference and analysis and call for integration of these practices more generally in research methodology.},

  abstract = {In the spring of 2021, reports of rare and unusual venous thrombosis in association with the ChAdOx1 and Ad26. COV2.S adenovirus-based coronavirus vaccines led to a brief suspension of their use by several countries. Thromboses in the cerebral and splanchnic veins among patients vaccinated in the preceding 4 weeks were described in 17 patients out of 7.98 million recipients of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (with 3 fatalities related to cerebral vein thrombosis) and 169 cases of cerebral vein thrombosis among 35 million ChAdOx1 recipients. Events were associated with thrombocytopenia and anti-PF4 (antibodies directed against platelet factor 4), leading to the designation vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. Unlike the related heparin-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, with an estimated incidence of {$<$}1:1000 patients treated with heparin, and a mortality rate of 25\%, vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia has been reported in 1:150\,000 ChAdOx1 recipients and 1:470\,000 Ad26.COV.2 recipients, with a reported mortality rate of 20\% to 30\%. Early recognition of this complication should prompt testing for anti-PF4 antibodies and acute treatment targeting the autoimmune and prothrombotic processes. Intravenous immunoglobulin (1 g/kg for 2 days), consideration of plasma exchange, and nonheparin anticoagulation (argatroban, fondaparinux) are recommended. In cases of cerebral vein thrombosis, one should monitor for and treat the known complications of venous congestion as they would in patients without vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. Now that the Ad26.COV2.S has been reapproved for use in several countries, it remains a critical component of our pharmacological armamentarium in stopping the spread of the human coronavirus and should be strongly recommended to patients. At this time, the patient and community-level benefits of these two adenoviral vaccines vastly outweigh the rare but serious risks of vaccination. Due to the relatively low risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in young women ({$<$}50 years), it is reasonable to recommend an alternative vaccine if one is available. Ongoing postmarketing observational studies are important for tracking new vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia cases and other rare side effects of these emergent interventions.},

The authors performed a retrospective analysis in 86 consecutive patients with Fisher Grade 3 aSAH due to rupture of a supratentorial aneurysm who presented within 36 hours and were treated by surgical clipping within 48 hours of their ictus. Forty-three patients were managed postoperatively with a low-dose intravenous heparin infusion (Maryland low-dose intravenous heparin infusion protocol: 8 U/kg/hr progressing over 36 hours to 10 U/kg/hr) beginning 12 hours after surgery and continuing until Day 14 after the ictus. Forty-three control patients received conventional subcutaneous heparin twice daily as deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Results. Patients in the 2 groups were balanced in terms of baseline characteristics. In the heparin group, activated partial thromboplastin times were normal to mildly elevated; no clinically significant hemorrhages or instances of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or deep vein thrombosis were encountered. In the control group, the incidence of clinical vasospasm requiring rescue therapy (induced hypertension, selective intraarterial verapamil, and angioplasty) was 20 (47\%) of 43 patients, and 9 (21\%) of 43 patients experienced a delayed infarct on CT scanning. In the heparin group, the incidence of clinical vasospasm requiring rescue therapy was 9\% (4 of 43, p = 0.0002), and no patient suffered a delayed infarct (p = 0.003). Conclusions. In patients with Fisher Grade 3 aSAH whose aneurysm is secured, postprocedure use of a low-dose intravenous heparin infusion may be safe and beneficial.

  abstract = {Besides the established spot sign (SS) in computed tomography angiography (CTA), there is growing evidence that different imaging markers in noncontrast CT offer great value for outcome prediction in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, it is unclear how the concurrent presence of each sign independently contributes to the predictive power of poor outcome. We, therefore, aimed to clarify the predictive value of 5 recently published noncontrast CT parameters (blend sign, black hole sign, island sign, hematoma heterogeneity, and hypodensities) and the established SS in 1 consecutive series of patients with ICH. Retrospective study of patients with ICH at 2 German tertiary stroke centers; inclusion criteria were (1) spontaneous ICH and (2) noncontrast CT and CTA performed on admission within 6 hours after onset of symptoms. We defined a binary outcome (good outcome [modified Rankin Scale score of {$\leq$}3] versus poor outcome [modified Rankin Scale score of {$>$}3]) at discharge. The predictive value of each sign was assessed in univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. Of 201 patients with spontaneous ICH, 28 (13.9\%) presented with black hole sign, 38 (18.9\%) with blend sign, 120 (59.7\%) with hypodensities, 97 (48.3\%) with heterogeneous densities, 53 with island sign (26.4\%), and 45 (22.4\%) with SS. In univariable logistic regression, higher hematoma volume (P{$<$}0.001), intraventricular hemorrhage (P=0.002), and the presence of black hole sign/blend sign/hypodensities/island sign/SS/heterogeneous density (all P{$<$}0.001) on admission CT were associated with poor outcome. Multivariable analysis confirmed intraventricular hemorrhage (odds ratio, 2.20; P=0.025), higher hematoma volume (odds ratio, 1.02 per mL; P{$<$}0.019), the presence of hypodensities (odds ratio, 2.47; P=0.018), and SS (odds ratio, 12.22; P{$<$}0.001) as independent predictors of poor outcome. This study demonstrates the degree of interaction between 5 recent noncontrast CT imaging markers and SS and their individual contribution for outcome prediction in patients with ICH. Of the CT variables indicating poor outcome SS on CTA and hypodensities were the most reliable outcome predictors.}

  abstract = {Background and Purpose- This study determined the influence of concomitant antiplatelet therapy (APT) on hematoma characteristics and outcome in primary spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), vitamin K antagonist (VKA)- and non-VKA oral anticoagulant-associated ICH. Methods- Data of retrospective cohort studies and a prospective single-center study were pooled. Functional outcome, mortality, and radiological characteristics were defined as primary and secondary outcomes. Propensity score matching and logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association between single or dual APT and hematoma volume. Results- A total of 3580 patients with ICH were screened, of whom 3545 with information on APT were analyzed. Three hundred forty-six (32.4\%) patients in primary spontaneous ICH, 260 (11.4\%) in VKA-ICH, and 30 (16.0\%) in non-VKA oral anticoagulant-associated ICH were on APT, and these patients had more severe comorbidities. After propensity score matching VKA-ICH patients on APT presented with less favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-3; APT, 48/202 [23.8\%] versus no APT, 187/587 [31.9\%]; P=0.030) and higher mortality (APT, 103/202 [51.0\%] versus no APT, 237/587 [40.4\%]; P=0.009), whereas no significant differences were present in primary spontaneous ICH and non-VKA oral anticoagulant-associated ICH. In VKA-ICH, hematoma volume was significantly larger in patients with APT (21.9 [7.4-61.4] versus 15.7 [5.7-44.5] mL; P=0.005). Multivariable regression analysis revealed an association of APT and larger ICH volumes (odds ratio, 1.80 [1.20-2.70]; P=0.005), which was more pronounced in dual APT and supratherapeutically anticoagulated patients. Conclusions- APT does not affect ICH characteristics and outcome in primary spontaneous ICH patients; however, it is associated with larger ICH volume and worse functional outcome in VKA-ICH, presumably by additive antihemostatic effects. Combination of anticoagulation and APT should, therefore, be diligently evaluated and restricted to the shortest possible time frame.},

  abstract = {Clinical prediction models provide risk estimates for the presence of disease (diagnosis) or an event in the future course of disease (prognosis) for individual patients. Although publications that present and evaluate such models are becoming more frequent, the methodology is often suboptimal. We propose that seven steps should be considered in developing prediction models: (i) consideration of the research question and initial data inspection; (ii) coding of predictors; (iii) model specification; (iv) model estimation; (v) evaluation of model performance; (vi) internal validation; and (vii) model presentation. The validity of a prediction model is ideally assessed in fully independent data, where we propose four key measures to evaluate model performance: calibration-in-the-large, or the model intercept (A); calibration slope (B); discrimination, with a concordance statistic (C); and clinical usefulness, with decision-curve analysis (D). As an application, we develop and validate prediction models for 30-day mortality in patients with an acute myocardial infarction. This illustrates the usefulness of the proposed framework to strengthen the methodological rigour and quality for prediction models in cardiovascular research.}

We studied the agreement and validity of predictions for individual patients.Study Design and SettingWe compared predictions from five predictive logistic regression models for short-term mortality after AMI. Three models were developed previously, and two models were developed in the GUSTO-I data, where all five models were applied (n =40,830, 7.0\% 30-day mortality). Agreement was studied with weighted kappa statistics of categorized predictions. Validity was assessed by comparing observed frequencies with predictions (indicating calibration) and by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), indicating discriminative ability.ResultsThe predictions from the five models varied considerably for individual patients, with low agreement between most (kappa {$<$}0.6). Risk predictions from the three previously developed models were on average too high, which could be corrected by re-calibration of the model intercept. The AUC ranged from 0.76\textendash 0.78 and increased to 0.78\textendash 0.79 with re-estimated regression coefficients that were optimal for the GUSTO-I patients. The two more detailed GUSTO-I based models performed better (AUC {$\sim$}0.82).ConclusionModels with different predictors may have a similar validity while the agreement between predictions for individual patients is poor. The main concerns in the applicability of predictive models for AMI should relate to the selected predictors and average calibration.}

  abstract = {Delirium is the most common manifestation of brain dysfunction in critically ill patients. In the intensive care unit (ICU), duration of delirium is independently predictive of excess death, length of stay, cost of care, and acquired dementia. There are numerous neurotransmitter/functional and/or injury-causing hypotheses rather than a unifying mechanism for delirium. Without using a validated delirium instrument, delirium can be misdiagnosed (under, but also overdiagnosed and trivialized), supporting the recommendation to use a monitoring instrument routinely. The best-validated ICU bedside instruments are CAM-ICU and ICDSC, both of which also detect subsyndromal delirium. Both tools have some inherent limitations in the neurologically injured patients, yet still provide valuable information about delirium once the sequelae of the primary injury settle into a new post-injury baseline. Now it is known that antipsychotics and other psychoactive medications do not reliably improve brain function in critically ill delirious patients. ICU teams should systematically screen for predisposing and precipitating factors. These include exacerbations of cardiac/respiratory failure or sepsis, metabolic disturbances (hypoglycemia, dysnatremia, uremia and ammonemia) receipt of psychoactive medications, and sensory deprivation through prolonged immobilization, uncorrected vision and hearing deficits, poor sleep hygiene, and isolation from loved ones so common during COVID19 pandemic. The ABCDEF (A2F) bundle is a means to facilitate implementation of the 2018 Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep Disruption in Adult Patients in the ICU (PADIS) Guidelines. In over 25,000 patients across nearly 100 institutions, the A2F bundle has been shown in a dose\textendash response fashion (i.e., greater bundle compliance) to yield improved survival, length of stay, coma and delirium duration, cost, and less ICU bounce-backs and discharge to nursing homes.},

  abstract = {Evidence-based medicine (EBM) calls on clinicians to incorporate the `best available evidence' into clinical decision-making. For decisions regarding treatment, the best evidence is that which determines the causal effect of treatments on the clinical outcomes of interest. Unfortunately, research often provides evidence where associations are not due to cause-and-effect, but rather due to non-causal reasons. These non-causal associations may provide valid evidence for diagnosis or prognosis, but biased evidence for treatment effects. Causal inference aims to determine when we can infer that associations are or are not due to causal effects. Since recommending treatments that do not have beneficial causal effects will not improve health, causal inference can advance the practice of EBM. The purpose of this article is to familiarise clinicians with some of the concepts and terminology that are being used in the field of causal inference, including graphical diagrams known as `causal directed acyclic graphs'. In order to demonstrate some of the links between causal inference methods and clinical treatment decisionmaking, we use a clinical vignette of assessing treatments to lower cardiovascular risk. As the field of causal inference advances, clinicians familiar with the methods and terminology will be able to improve their adherence to the principles of EBM by distinguishing causal effects of treatment from results due to non-causal associations that may be a source of bias.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multicenter retrospective medical record review analyzed clinical and EEG data from patients 18 years or older with a clinical indication for cEEG and an EEG duration of 12 hours or longer who were receiving consecutive cEEG at 6 centers from January 2012 to January 2019. 2HELPS2B was evaluated with the validation cohort using the mean calibration error (CAL), a measure of the difference between prediction and actual results. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to determine the duration of EEG monitoring to achieve a seizure risk of less than 5\% based on the 2HELPS2B score calculated on first- hour (screening) EEG. Participants undergoing elective epilepsy monitoring and those who had experienced cardiac arrest were excluded. No participants who met the inclusion criteria were excluded. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome was a CAL error of less than 5\% in the validation cohort. RESULTS The study included 2111 participants (median age, 51 years; 1113 men [52.7\%]; median EEG duration, 48 hours) and the primary outcome was met with a validation cohort CAL error of 4.0\% compared with a CAL of 2.7\% in the foundational cohort (P = .13). For the 2HELPS2B score calculated on only the first hour of EEG in those without seizures during that hour, the CAL error remained at less than 5.0\% at 4.2\% and allowed for stratifying patients into low(2HELPS2B = 0; {$<$}5\% risk of seizures), medium- (2HELPS2B = 1; 12\% risk of seizures), and high-risk (2HELPS2B, Ն2; risk of seizures, {$>$}25\%) groups. Each of the categories had an associated minimum recommended duration of EEG monitoring to achieve at least a less than 5\% risk of seizures, a 2HELPS2B score of 0 at 1-hour screening EEG, a 2HELPS2B score of 1 at 12 hours, and a 2HELPS2B score of 2 or greater at 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, 2HELPS2B was validated as a clinical tool to aid in seizure detection, clinical communication, and cEEG use in hospitalized patients. In patients without prior clinical seizures, a screening 1-hour EEG that showed no epileptiform findings was an adequate screen. In patients with any highly epileptiform EEG patterns during the first hour of EEG (ie, a 2HELPS2B score of Ն2), at least 24 hours of recording is recommended.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used a prospective multicenter (Emory University Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Yale University Hospital) database containing clinical and electrographic variables on 5427 continuous EEG sessions from eligible patients if they had continuous EEG for clinical indications, excluding epilepsy monitoring unit admissions. We created a scoring system model to estimate seizure risk in acutely ill patients undergoing continuous EEG. The model was built using a new machine learning method (RiskSLIM) that is designed to produce accurate, risk-calibrated scoring systems with a limited number of variables and small integer weights. We validated the accuracy and risk calibration of our model using cross-validation and compared its performance with models built with state-of-the-art logistic regression methods. The database was developed by the Critical Care EEG Research Consortium and used data collected over 3 years. The EEG variables were interpreted using standardized terminology by certified reviewers. EXPOSURES All patients had more than 6 hours of uninterrupted EEG recordings. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome was the average risk calibration error.

Our final model, 2HELPS2B, had an area under the curve of 0.819 and average calibration error of 2.7\% (95\% CI, 2.0\%-3.6\%). It included 6 variables with the following point assignments: (1) brief (ictal) rhythmic discharges (B[I]RDs) (2 points); (2) presence of lateralized periodic discharges, lateralized rhythmic delta activity, or bilateral independent periodic discharges (1 point); (3) prior seizure (1 point); (4) sporadic epileptiform discharges (1 point); (5) frequency greater than 2.0 Hz for any periodic or rhythmic pattern (1 point); and (6) presence of ``plus'' features (superimposed, rhythmic, sharp, or fast activity) (1 point). The probable seizure risk of each score was 5\% for a score of 0, 12\% for a score of 1, 27\% for a score of 2, 50\% for a score of 3, 73\% for a score of 4, 88\% for a score of 5, and greater than 95\% for a score of 6 or 7. Editorial page 1395 CME Quiz at jamanetwork.com/learning CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The 2HELPS2B model is a quick accurate tool to aid clinical judgment of the risk of seizures in critically ill patients.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological studies project a significant rise in cases of chronic subdural haematoma over the next 20 years. Patients with this condition are frequently older and medically complex, with baseline characteristics that may increase peri-operative risk. The intra-operative period is only a small portion of a patient's total hospital stay, with a majority of patients in the United Kingdom transferred between institutions for their surgical and rehabilitative care. Definitive management remains surgical, but peri-operative challenges exist which resonate with other surgical cohorts where multidisciplinary working has become the gold standard. These include shared decision-making, medical optimisation, the management of peri-operative anticoagulation and the identification of key points of equipoise for examination in the future trials. In this narrative review, we use a stereotyped patient journey to provide context to the recent literature, highlighting where multidisciplinary expertise may be required to optimise patient care and maximise the benefits of surgical management. We discuss the triage, pre-operative optimisation, intra-operative management and immediate postoperative care of patients undergoing surgery for a chronic subdural haematoma. We also discuss where adjunctive medical management may be indicated. In so doing, we present the current and emerging evidence base for the role of an integrated peri-operative medicine team in the care of patients with a chronic subdural haematoma.},

Design: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database. Setting: Neurosciences critical care unit of a large academic tertiary care hospital. Patients: Adult patients (n \&equals; 2381) admitted to our neurosciences critical care unit from January 1997 to April 2000. Interventions: Introduction of a specialized neurocritical care team. Measurements and Main Results: Data obtained from the database included demographics, admission source, length of stay, neurosciences critical care unit and hospital disposition, admission Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score, and principal and secondary diagnoses. The introduction of a neurocritical care team in September 1998 was also collected, as was death at 1 yr after admission. Univariate analysis was carried out using Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, or chi-square test (significance, p {$<$} .05). A logistic regression model was used to create a prediction model for in-hospital and long-term mortality. A general linear model was used to determine predictors of length of stay (after log transformation). Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality included APACHE III (odds ratio, 1.07 \&lsqb;1.06\textendash 1.08\&rsqb;) and admission from another intensive care unit (odds ratio, 2.9 \&lsqb;1.4\textendash 6.2\&rsqb;). The presence of a neurocritical care team was an independent predictor of decreased mortality (odds ratio, 0.7 \&lsqb;0.5\textendash 1.0\&rsqb;, p \&equals; .044). Admission after the neurocritical care team was implemented was associated with reduced length of stay in both the neurosciences critical care unit (4.2 {$\pm$} 4.0 vs. 3.7 {$\pm$} 3.4, p {$<$} .001) and the hospital (9.9 {$\pm$} 8.0 vs. 8.4 {$\pm$} 6.9, p {$<$} .0001). There was no difference in readmission rates to the intensive care unit or discharge disposition to home before and after the neurocritical care team was established. The availability of the neurocritical care team was not associated with significant changes in long-term mortality. Factors independently associated with long-term mortality included female gender, admission from another intensive care unit, APACHE III score, and being moderately disabled before admission. Conclusion: Introduction of a neurocritical care team, including a full-time neurointensivist who coordinated care, was associated with significantly reduced in-hospital mortality and length of stay without changes in readmission rates or long-term mortality.}

We discuss the following ten pitfalls and tips that are easily overlooked when using DAGs: 1) Each node on DAGs corresponds to a random variable and not its realized values; 2) The presence or absence of arrows in DAGs corresponds to the presence or absence of individual causal effect in the population; 3) ``Non-manipulable'' variables and their arrows should be drawn with care; 4) It is preferable to draw DAGs for the total population, rather than for the exposed or unexposed groups; 5) DAGs are primarily useful to examine the presence of confounding in distribution in the notion of confounding in expectation; 6) Although DAGs provide qualitative differences of causal structures, they cannot describe details of how to adjust for confounding; 7) DAGs can be used to illustrate the consequences of matching and the appropriate handling of matched variables in cohort and case-control studies; 8) When explicitly accounting for temporal order in DAGs, it is necessary to use separate nodes for each timing; 9) In certain cases, DAGs with signed edges can be used in drawing conclusions about the direction of bias; and 10) DAGs can be (and should be) used to describe not only confounding bias but also other forms of bias.

Identification of those at increased risk of developing delirium early in the surgical pathway provides an opportunity for modification of predisposing and precipitating risk factors and effective shared decision-making. No single delirium prediction tool is used widely in surgical settings. Multi-component interventions to prevent delirium involve structured risk factor modification supported by geriatrician input; these are clinically efficacious and cost effective. Barriers to the widespread implementation of such complex interventions exist, resulting in an `implementation gap'. There is a lack of evidence for pharmacological prophylaxis for the prevention of delirium. Current evidence suggests that avoidance of peri-operative benzodiazepines, careful titration of anaesthetic depth guided by processed electroencephalogram monitoring and treatment of pain are the most effective strategies to minimise the risk of delirium. Addressing postoperative delirium requires a collaborative, whole pathway approach, beginning with the early identification of those patients who are at risk. The research agenda should continue to examine the potential for pharmacological prophylaxis to prevent delirium while also addressing how successful models of delirium prevention can be translated from one setting to another, underpinned by implementation science methodology.},

Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with spontaneous, nontraumatic ICH over a 3-year period between January 2013 and December 2016. Demographics, clinical measures, and outcomes were compared between ICH patients with positive methamphetamine toxicology tests vs those with negative methamphetamine toxicology tests. Results Methamphetamine-positive ICH patients were younger than methamphetamine-negative ICH patients (52 vs 67 years, p {$<$} 0.001). Patients with methamphetamine-positive ICH had higher diastolic blood pressure (115 vs 101, p = 0.003), higher mean arterial pressure (144 vs 129, p = 0.01), longer lengths of hospital (18 vs 8 days, p {$<$} 0.001) and intensive care unit (ICU) stay (10 vs 5 days, p {$<$} 0.001), required more days of IV antihypertensive medications (5 vs 3 days, p = 0.02), and had more subcortical hemorrhages (63\% vs 46\%, p = 0.05). The methamphetaminepositive group had better premorbid modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores (p {$<$} 0.001) and a greater change in functional ability as measured by mRS at the time of hospital discharge (p = 0.001). In multivariate analyses, methamphetamine use predicted both hospital length of stay (risk ratio [RR] 1.54, confidence interval [CI] 1.39\textendash 1.70, p {$<$} 0.001) and ICU length of stay (RR 1.36, CI 1.18\textendash 1.56, p {$<$} 0.001), but did not predict poor outcome (mRS 4\textendash 6). Conclusions Methamphetamine use is associated with earlier age at onset of ICH, longer hospital stays, and greater change in functional ability, but did not predict outcome.},

SETTING: Eight medical-surgical ICUs in Toronto. PATIENTS: Adult patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, with a first successful spontaneous breathing trial within 28 days of initial ICU admission. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary end point had three mutually exclusive levels, including: 1) withholding extubation after a successful spontaneous breathing trial, 2) extubation failure within 48 hours, and 3) successful extubation. Among 9,910 patients, 38\% of patients were not extubated within 24 hours of their first successful spontaneous breathing trial. A total of 12.9\% of patients who were promptly extubated failed within the next 48 hours. Several discrepancies were evident in the association of factors with risk of withholding extubation and extubation failure. Specifically, both age and female sex were associated with withholding extubation (odds ratio, 1.07; 95\% CI, 1.03\textendash 1.11; and odds ratio, 1.13; 95\% CI, 1.02\textendash 1.26, respectively) but not a higher risk of failed extubation (odds ratio, 0.99; 95\% CI, 0.93\textendash 1.05; and odds ratio, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.77\textendash 1.11, respectively). Conversely, both acute cardiovascular conditions and intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure were associated with a higher risk of failed extubation (odds ratio, 1.32; 95\% CI, 1.06\textendash 1.66; and odds ratio, 1.46; 95\% CI, 1.16\textendash 1.82, respectively) but not a higher odds of a withheld extubation attempt (odds ratio, 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.68\textendash 0.91; and odds ratio, 1.07; 95\% CI, 0.93\textendash 1.23, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Several factors showed discordance between the decision to withhold extubation and the risk of extubation failure. This discordance may lead to longer duration of mechanical ventilation or higher reintubation rates. Improving the decision-making behind extubation may help to reduce both exposure to invasive mechanical ventilation and extubation failure.},

This study evaluated the feasibility and safety of CA-guided CPP management in TBI patients requiring intracranial pressure monitoring and therapy (TBIicp patients). The CPPopt Guided Therapy: Assessment of Target Effectiveness (COGiTATE) parallel two-arm feasibility trial took place in four tertiary centers. TBIicp patients were randomized to either the Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) guideline CPP target range (control group) or to the individualized CA-guided CPP targets (intervention group). CPP targets were guided by six times daily software-based alerts for up to 5 days. The primary feasibility end-point was the percentage of time with CPP concordant (\textendash 5 mm Hg) with the set CPP targets. The main secondary safety endpoint was an increase in therapeutic intensity level (TIL) between the control and intervention group. Twenty-eight patients were randomized to the control and 32 patients to the intervention group. CPP in the intervention group was in the target range for 46.5\% (interquartile range, 41.2\textendash 58) of the monitored time, significantly higher than the feasibility target specified in the published protocol (36\%; p {$<$} 0.001). There were no significant differences between groups for TIL or for other safety end-points. Conclusively, targeting an individual and dynamic CA-guided CPP is feasible and safe in TBIicp patients. This encourages a prospective trial powered for clinical outcomes.},

DESIGN: Secondary analysis of three prospective, observational, multicenter studies. SETTING: Cohort studies conducted in 2004, 2010, and 2016. PATIENTS: Adult patients who received mechanical ventilation for more than 12 hours. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among the 20,929 patients enrolled, we included 4,152 (20\%) mechanically ventilated patients due to different neurologic diseases. Hemorrhagic stroke and brain trauma were the most common pathologies associated with the need for mechanical ventilation. Although volume-cycled ventilation remained the preferred ventilation mode, there was a significant (p {$<$} 0.001) increment in the use of pressure support ventilation. The proportion of patients receiving a protective lung ventilation strategy was increased over time: 47\% in 2004, 63\% in 2010, and 65\% in 2016 (p {$<$} 0.001), as well as the duration of protective ventilation strategies: 406 days per 1,000 mechanical ventilation days in 2004, 523 days per 1,000 mechanical ventilation days in 2010, and 585 days per 1,000 mechanical ventilation days in 2016 (p {$<$} 0.001). There were no differences in the length of stay in the ICU, mortality in the ICU, and mortality in hospital from 2004 to 2016. Independent risk factors for 28-day mortality were age greater than 75 years, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II greater than 50, the occurrence of organ dysfunction within first 48 hours after brain injury, and specific neurologic diseases such as hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke, and brain trauma. CONCLUSIONS: More lung-protective ventilatory strategies have been implemented over years in neurologic patients with no effect on pulmonary complications or on survival. We found several prognostic factors on mortality such as advanced age, the severity of the disease, organ dysfunctions, and the etiology of neurologic disease.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines\textemdash mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech)\textemdash and COVID-19 hospitalization, and, among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the association with progression to critical disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A US 21-site case-control analysis of 4513 adults hospitalized between March 11 and August 15, 2021, with 28-day outcome data on death and mechanical ventilation available for patients enrolled through July 14, 2021. Date of final follow-up was August 8, 2021. EXPOSURES COVID-19 vaccination. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Associations were evaluated between prior vaccination and (1) hospitalization for COVID-19, in which case patients were those hospitalized for COVID-19 and control patients were those hospitalized for an alternative diagnosis; and (2) disease progression among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, in which cases and controls were COVID-19 patients with and without progression to death or mechanical ventilation, respectively. Associations were measured with multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS Among 4513 patients (median age, 59 years [IQR, 45-69]; 2202 [48.8\%] women; 23.0\% non-Hispanic Black individuals, 15.9\% Hispanic individuals, and 20.1\% with an immunocompromising condition), 1983 were case patients with COVID-19 and 2530 were controls without COVID-19. Unvaccinated patients accounted for 84.2\% (1669/1983) of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Hospitalization for COVID-19 was significantly associated with decreased likelihood of vaccination (cases, 15.8\%; controls, 54.8\%; adjusted OR, 0.15; 95\% CI, 0.13-0.18), including for sequenced SARS-CoV-2 Alpha (8.7\% vs 51.7\%; aOR, 0.10; 95\% CI, 0.06-0.16) and Delta variants (21.9\% vs 61.8\%; aOR, 0.14; 95\% CI, 0.10-0.21). This association was stronger for immunocompetent patients (11.2\% vs 53.5\%; aOR, 0.10; 95\% CI, 0.09-0.13) than immunocompromisedpatients(40.1\%vs58.8\%;aOR,0.49;95\%CI,0.35-0.69)(P {$<$} .001)andweaker at more than 120 days since vaccination with BNT162b2 (5.8\% vs 11.5\%; aOR, 0.36; 95\% CI, 0.270.49) than with mRNA-1273 (1.9\% vs 8.3\%; aOR, 0.15; 95\% CI, 0.09-0.23) (P {$<$} .001). Among 1197 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, death or invasive mechanical ventilation by day 28 was associated with decreased likelihood of vaccination (12.0\% vs 24.7\%; aOR, 0.33; 95\% CI, 0.19-0.58). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was significantly less likely among patients with COVID-19 hospitalization and disease progression to death or mechanical ventilation. These findings are consistent with risk reduction among vaccine breakthrough infections compared with absence of vaccination.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To assess the effects of 12 mg/d vs 6 mg/d of dexamethasone in patients with COVID-19 and severe hypoxemia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A multicenter, randomized clinical trial was conducted between August 2020 and May 2021 at 26 hospitals in Europe and India and included 1000 adults with confirmed COVID-19 requiring at least 10 L/min of oxygen or mechanical ventilation. End of 90-day follow-up was on August 19, 2021. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 1:1 to 12 mg/d of intravenous dexamethasone (n = 503) or 6 mg/d of intravenous dexamethasone (n = 497) for up to 10 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the number of days alive without life support (invasive mechanical ventilation, circulatory support, or kidney replacement therapy) at 28 days and was adjusted for stratification variables. Of the 8 prespecified secondary outcomes, 5 are included in this analysis (the number of days alive without life support at 90 days, the number of days alive out of the hospital at 90 days, mortality at 28 days and at 90 days, and Ն1 serious adverse reactions at 28 days). RESULTS Of the 1000 randomized patients, 982 were included (median age, 65 [IQR, 55-73] years; 305 [31\%] women) and primary outcome data were available for 971 (491 in the 12 mg of dexamethasone group and 480 in the 6 mg of dexamethasone group). The median number of days alive without life support was 22.0 days (IQR, 6.0-28.0 days) in the 12 mg of dexamethasone group and 20.5 days (IQR, 4.0-28.0 days) in the 6 mg of dexamethasone group (adjusted mean difference, 1.3 days [95\% CI, 0-2.6 days]; P = .07). Mortality at 28 days was 27.1\% in the 12 mg of dexamethasone group vs 32.3\% in the 6 mg of dexamethasone group (adjusted relative risk, 0.86 [99\% CI, 0.68-1.08]). Mortality at 90 days was 32.0\% in the 12 mg of dexamethasone group vs 37.7\% in the 6 mg of dexamethasone group (adjusted relative risk, 0.87 [99\% CI, 0.70-1.07]). Serious adverse reactions, including septic shock and invasive fungal infections, occurred in 11.3\% in the 12 mg of dexamethasone group vs 13.4\% in the 6 mg of dexamethasone group (adjusted relative risk, 0.83 [99\% CI, 0.54-1.29]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with COVID-19 and severe hypoxemia, 12 mg/d of dexamethasone compared with 6 mg/d of dexamethasone did not result in statistically significantly more days alive without life support at 28 days. However, the trial may have been underpowered to identify a significant difference.},

The widespread use of these CDEs promotes harmonized data collection in clinical research. The aim of the NINDS Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (UIA) and Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH), and Subject Characteristics working group (WG) was to identify, define, and classify CDEs describing the characteristics of patients diagnosed with an UIA and SAH. Thus, ``Participant/ Subject characteristics'' is a set of factors defining a population of selected individuals and allowing comparisons with a reference population and overtime. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} Based on standard terms defined by the United States' Census Bureau, CDEs previously defined by several (Stroke, Epilepsy and Traumatic Brain Injury) NINDS CDE working groups literature and expert opinion of the WG, the ``Participant/Subject characteristics'' domain has been defined. Results:\hspace{0.6em} A set of 192 CDEs divided in 7 subsections: demographics (8 CDEs), social status (8 CDEs), behavioral status (22 CDEs), family and medical history (144 CDEs), pregnancy and perinatal history (8 CDEs), history data source reliability (3 CDEs), and prior functional status (3 CDEs) was defined. SAH is characterized by 6 core elements, all classified in the ``Participant/Subject characteristics'' domain. Four exploratory elements out of the 39 for SAH overall are in the ``Participant/Subject characteristics'' domain, and all remaining 182 CDEs in the ``Participant/Subject characteristics'' domain are classified as Supplemental-Highly Recommended elements. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} These CDEs would allow the development of best practice guidelines to standardize the assessment and reporting of observations concerning UIA and SAH.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Antiplatelet therapy (APT) promotes bleeding; therefore, APT might worsen outcome in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to address the hypothesis that pre-ICH APT use is associated with mortality and poor functional outcome following ICH. METHODS: The Medline and Embase databases were searched in February 2008 using relevant key words, limited to human studies in the English language. Cohort studies of consecutive patients with ICH reporting mortality or functional outcome according to pre-ICH APT use were identified. Of 2,873 studies screened, 10 were judged to meet inclusion criteria by consensus of 2 authors. Additionally, we solicited unpublished data from all authors of cohort studies with {$>$}100 patients published within the last 10 years, and received data from 15 more studies. Univariate and multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for mortality and poor functional outcome were abstracted as available and pooled using a random effects model. RESULTS: We obtained mortality data from 25 cohorts (15 unpublished) and functional outcome data from 21 cohorts (14 unpublished). Pre-ICH APT users had increased mortality in both univariate (OR 1.41, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.21 to 1.64) and multivariable-adjusted (OR 1.27, 95\% CI 1.10 to 1.47) pooled analyses. By contrast, the pooled OR for poor functional outcome was no longer significant when using multivariable-adjusted estimates (univariate OR 1.29, 95\% CI 1.09 to 1.53; multivariable-adjusted OR 1.10, 95\% CI 0.93 to 1.29). CONCLUSIONS: In cohort studies, APT use at the time of ICH compared to no APT use was independently associated with increased mortality but not with poor functional outcome.},

However, most studies failed to apply fully the necessary methodological techniques that systematically deal with different biases and confounding, which not only limits their scientific merit but may result in harm through misleading information. In this article, we address a few important biases that can seriously threaten the validity of observational studies of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We focus on treatment selection bias due to patients' preference on goals of care, medical futility and disability bias, survivor bias, competing risks, and the misuse of propensity score analysis. We attempt to raise awareness and to help readers assess shortcomings of observational studies of interventions in COVID-19.},

Whereas our companion paper summarizes fundamental issues, this article focuses on more complex, task-specific aspects of presenting numeric information in patient decision aids.                                         Methods               As part of the International Patient Decision Aids Standards third evidence update, we gathered an expert panel of 9 international experts who revised and expanded the topics covered in the 2013 review working in groups of 2 to 3 to update the evidence, based on their expertise and targeted searches of the literature. The full panel then reviewed and provided additional revisions, reaching consensus on the final version.                                         Results               Five of the 10 topics addressed more complex task-specific issues. We found strong evidence for using independent event rates and/or incremental absolute risk differences for the effect size of test and screening outcomes. Simple visual formats can help to reduce common judgment biases and enhance comprehension but can be misleading if not well designed. Graph literacy can moderate the effectiveness of visual formats and hence should be considered in tool design. There is less evidence supporting the inclusion of personalized and interactive risk estimates.                                         Discussion               More complex numeric information. such as the size of the benefits and harms for decision options, can be better understood by using incremental absolute risk differences alongside well-designed visual formats that consider the graph literacy of the intended audience. More research is needed into when and how to use personalized and/or interactive risk estimates because their complexity and accessibility may affect their feasibility in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Evidence-based medicine is valuable to the extent that the evidence base is complete and unbiased. Selective publication of clinical trials \textemdash{} and the outcomes within those trials \textemdash{} can lead to unrealistic estimates of drug effectiveness and alter the apparent risk\textendash benefit ratio. METHODS We obtained reviews from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for studies of 12 antidepressant agents involving 12,564 patients. We conducted a systematic literature search to identify matching publications. For trials that were reported in the literature, we compared the published outcomes with the FDA outcomes. We also compared the effect size derived from the published reports with the effect size derived from the entire FDA data set. N Engl J Med 2008;358:252-60. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2008 Massachusetts Medical Society. RESULTS Among 74 FDA-registered studies, 31\%, accounting for 3449 study participants, were not published. Whether and how the studies were published were associated with the study outcome. A total of 37 studies viewed by the FDA as having positive results were published; 1 study viewed as positive was not published. Studies viewed by the FDA as having negative or questionable results were, with 3 exceptions, either not published (22 studies) or published in a way that, in our opinion, conveyed a positive outcome (11 studies). According to the published literature, it appeared that 94\% of the trials conducted were positive. By contrast, the FDA analysis showed that 51\% were positive. Separate meta-analyses of the FDA and journal data sets showed that the increase in effect size ranged from 11 to 69\% for individual drugs and was 32\% overall. CONCLUSIONS We cannot determine whether the bias observed resulted from a failure to submit manuscripts on the part of authors and sponsors, from decisions by journal editors and reviewers not to publish, or both. Selective reporting of clinical trial results may have adverse consequences for researchers, study participants, health care professionals, and patients.},

  abstract = {Recent positive trials have thrust acute cerebral perfusion imaging into the routine evaluation of acute ischemic stroke. Updated guidelines state that in patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusions presenting beyond 6 hours from time last known well, advanced imaging selection including perfusion-based selection is necessary. Centers that receive patients with acute stroke must now have the capability to perform and interpret CT or magnetic resonance perfusion imaging or provide rapid transfer to centers with the capability of selecting patients for a highly impactful endovascular therapy, particularly in delayed time windows. Many stroke centers are quickly incorporating the use of automated perfusion processing software to interpret perfusion raw data. As CT perfusion (CTP) is being assimilated in real-world clinical practice, it is essential to understand the basics of perfusion acquisition, quantification, and interpretation. It is equally important to recognize the common technical and clinical diagnostic challenges of automated CTP including ischemic core and penumbral misclassifications that could result in underestimation or overestimation of the core and penumbra volumes. This review highlights the pitfalls of automated CTP along with practical pearls to address the common challenges. This is particularly tailored to aid the acute stroke clinician who must interpret automated perfusion studies in an emergency setting to make time-dependent treatment decisions for patients with acute ischemic stroke.},

  abstract = {Intracerebral hemorrhage is a devastating disease with no specific treatment modalities. A significant proportion of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage are transferred to large stroke treatment centers, such as Comprehensive Stroke Centers, because of perceived need for higher level of care. However, evidence of improvement in patient-centered outcomes for these patients treated at larger stroke treatment centers as compared to community hospitals is lacking. ``Efficient Resource Utilization for Patients with Intracerebral Hemorrhage (EnRICH)'' is a prospective, multisite, state-wide, cohort study designed to assess the impact of level of care on long-term patient-centered outcomes for patients with primary / non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage. The study is funded by the Texas state legislature via the Lone Star Stroke Research Consortium. It is being implemented via major hub hospitals in large metropolitan cities across the state of Texas. Each hub has an extensive network of ``spoke'' hospitals, which are connected to the hub via traditional clinical and administrative arrangements, or by telemedicine technologies. This infrastructure provides a unique opportunity to track outcomes for intracerebral hemorrhage patients managed across a health system at various levels of care. Eligible patients are enrolled during hospitalization and are followed for functional, quality of life, cognitive, resource utilization, and dependency outcomes at 30 and 90 days post discharge. As a secondary aim, an economic analysis of the incremental cost-effectiveness of treating intracerebral hemorrhage patients at higher levels of care will be conducted. Findings from EnRICH will provide much needed evidence of the effectiveness and efficiency of regionalized care for intracerebral hemorrhage patients. Such evidence is required to inform policy and streamline clinical decision-making.}

  abstract = {Background: Despite regular criticisms of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), a focus on testing persists, sometimes in the belief to get published and sometimes encouraged by journal reviewers. This paper aims to demonstrate known key limitations of NHST using simple nontechnical illustrations. Design: The first illustration is based on simulated data of 20 000 studies that compare two groups for an outcome event. The true effect size (difference in event rates) and sample size (20-100 per group) were varied. The second illustration used real data from a meta-analysis on alpha-blockers for the treatment of ureteric stones. Results: The simulations demonstrated the large between-study variability in Pvalues (range between {$<$}.0001 and 1 for most simulation conditions). A focus on statistically significant effects (P {$<$} .05), notably in small to moderate samples, led to strongly overestimated effect sizes (up to 240\%) and many false-positive conclusions, that is statistically significant effects that were, in fact, true null effects. Effect sizes also exerted strong between-study variability, but confidence intervals accounted for this: the interval width decreased with larger sample size, and the percentage of intervals that contained the true effect size was accurate across simulation conditions. Reducing alpha level, as recently suggested, reduced false-positive conclusions but strongly increased the overestimation of significant effects (up to 320\%). Conclusions: Researchers and journals should abandon statistical significance as a pivotal element in most scientific publications. Confidence intervals around effect sizes are more informative, but should not merely be reported to comply with journal requirements.},

We describe cases in which intuition concerning signed edges fails and we characterize the directed acyclic graphs that researchers can use to draw conclusions about the sign of the bias of unmeasured confounding. If there is only one unmeasured confounding variable on the graph, then nonincreasing or nondecreasing average causal effects suffice to draw conclusions about the direction of the bias. When there are more than one unmeasured confounding variable, nonincreasing and nondecreasing average causal effects can be used to draw conclusions only if the various unmeasured confounding variables are independent of one another conditional on the measured covariates. When this conditional independence property does not hold, stronger notions of monotonicity are needed to draw conclusions about the direction of the bias.},

If the effect of measurement error is misjudged, the data analyses are hampered and the validity of the study's inferences may be affected. In this paper, we describe five myths that contribute to misjudgments about measurement error, regarding expected structure, impact and solutions to mitigate the problems resulting from mismeasurements. The aim is to clarify these measurement error misconceptions. We show that the influence of measurement error in an epidemiological data analysis can play out in ways that go beyond simple heuristics, such as heuristics about whether or not to expect attenuation of the effect estimates. Whereas we encourage epidemiologists to deliberate about the structure and potential impact of measurement error in their analyses, we also recommend exercising restraint when making claims about the magnitude or even direction of effect of measurement error if not accompanied by statistical measurement error corrections or quantitative bias analysis. Suggestions for alleviating the problems or investigating the structure and magnitude of measurement error are given.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} In patients with severe brain injury, withdrawal of life-sustaining measures (WLSM) is common in intensive care units (ICU). WLSM constitutes a dilemma: instituting WLSM too early could result in death despite the possibility of an acceptable functional outcome, whereas delaying WLSM could unnecessarily burden patients, families, clinicians, and hospital resources. We aimed to describe the occurrence and timing of WLSM, and factors associated with timing of WLSM in European ICUs in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods:\hspace{0.6em} The CENTER-TBI Study is a prospective multi-center cohort study. For the current study, patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) admitted to the ICU and aged 16 or older were included. Occurrence and timing of WLSM were documented. For the analyses, we dichotomized timing of WLSM in early ({$<$}\,72 h after injury) versus later ({$\geq$}\,72 h after injury) based on recent guideline recommendations. We assessed factors associated with initiating WLSM early versus later, including geographic region, center, patient, injury, and treatment characteristics with univariable and multivariable (mixed effects) logistic regression. Results:\hspace{0.6em} A total of 2022 patients aged 16 or older were admitted to the ICU. ICU mortality was 13\% (n\,=\,267). Of these, 229 (86\%) patients died after WLSM, and were included in the analyses. The occurrence of WLSM varied between regions ranging from 0\% in Eastern Europe to 96\% in Northern Europe. In 51\% of the patients, WLSM was early. Patients in the early WLSM group had a lower maximum therapy intensity level (TIL) score than patients in the later WLSM group (median of 5 versus 10) The strongest independent variables associated with early WLSM were one unreactive pupil (odds ratio (OR) 4.0, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.3\textendash 12.4) or two unreactive pupils (OR 5.8, CI 2.6\textendash 13.1) compared to two reactive pupils, and an Injury Severity Score (ISS) if over 41 (OR per point above 41\,=\,1.1, CI 1.0\textendash 1.1). Timing of WLSM was not significantly associated with region or center. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} WLSM occurs early in half of the patients, mostly in patients with severe TBI affecting brainstem reflexes who were severely injured. We found no regional or center influences in timing of WLSM. Whether WLSM is always appropriate or may contribute to a self-fulfilling prophecy requires further research and argues for reluctance to institute WLSM early in case of any doubt on prognosis.},

  abstract = {Objective: To determine if posttraumatic nonconvulsive electrographic seizures result in longterm brain atrophy. Methods: Prospective continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring was done in 140 patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and in-depth study of 16 selected patients was done using serial volumetric MRI acutely and at 6 months after TBI. Fluorodeoxyglucose PET was done in the acute stage in 14/16 patients. These data were retrospectively analyzed after collection of data for 7 years. Results: cEEG detected seizures in 32/140 (23\%) of the entire cohort. In the selected imaging subgroup, 6 patients with seizures were compared with a cohort of 10 age- and GCS-matched patients with TBI without seizures. In this subgroup, the seizures were repetitive and constituted status epilepticus in 4/6 patients. Patients with seizures had greater hippocampal atrophy as compared to those without seizures (21 Ϯ 9 vs 12 Ϯ 6\%, p ϭ 0.017). Hippocampi ipsilateral to the electrographic seizure focus demonstrated a greater degree of volumetric atrophy as compared with nonseizure hippocampi (28 Ϯ 5 vs 13 Ϯ 9\%, p ϭ 0.007). A single patient had an ictal PET scan which demonstrated increased hippocampal glucose uptake. Conclusion: Acute posttraumatic nonconvulsive seizures occur frequently after TBI and, in a selected subgroup, appear to be associated with disproportionate long-term hippocampal atrophy. These data suggest anatomic damage is potentially elicited by nonconvulsive seizures in the acute postinjury setting. Neurology\textregistered{} 2010;75:792\textendash 798},

We wondered how often statistically significant results in RCTs may be lost with small changes in the numbers of outcomes. Study Design and Setting: A review of RCTs in high-impact medical journals that reported a statistically significant result for at least one dichotomous or time-to-event outcome in the abstract. In the group with the smallest number of events, we changed the status of patients without an event to an event until the P-value exceeded 0.05. We labeled this number the Fragility Index; smaller numbers indicated a more fragile result. Results: The 399 eligible trials had a median sample size of 682 patients (range: 15e112,604) and a median of 112 events (range: 8e5,142); 53\% reported a P-value !0.01. The median Fragility Index was 8 (range: 0e109); 25\% had a Fragility Index of 3 or less. In 53\% of trials, the Fragility Index was less than the number of patients lost to follow-up. Conclusion: The statistically significant results of many RCTs hinge on small numbers of events. The Fragility Index complements the P-value and helps identify less robust results. \'O 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. Open access under CC BY-NC-ND license.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a significant risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Although ethnic/racial disparities related to hypertension and ICH have been reported, these previous studies were limited by a lack of Hispanics and inadequate power to analyze by ICH location. In the current study, while overcoming these prior limitations, we investigated whether there was variation by ethnicity/race of treated and untreated hypertension as risk factors for ICH. METHODS: The ERICH study (Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage) is a prospective, multicenter, case-control study of ICH among whites, blacks, and Hispanics. Cases were enrolled from 42 recruitment sites. Controls matched to cases 1:1 by age ({$\pm$}5 years), sex, ethnicity/race, and metropolitan area were identified by random-digit dialing. Subjects were interviewed to determine history of hypertension and use of antihypertensive medications. Cases and controls within ethnic groups were compared by using conditional logistic regression. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were computed for ICH as an overall group and separately for the location subcategories deep, lobar, and infratentorial (brainstem/cerebellar). RESULTS: Nine hundred fifty-eight white, 880 black, and 766 Hispanic ICH patients were enrolled. For ICH cases, untreated hypertension was higher in blacks (43.6\%, P{$<$}0.0001) and Hispanics (46.9\%, P{$<$}0.0001) versus whites (32.7\%). In multivariable analyses adjusted for alcohol use, anticoagulation, hypercholesterolemia, education, and medical insurance status, treated hypertension was a significant risk factor across all locations of ICH in whites (odds ratio [OR], 1.57; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.24\textendash 1.98; P{$<$}0.0001), blacks (OR, 3.02; 95\% CI, 2.16\textendash 4.22; P{$<$}0.0001), and Hispanics (OR, 2.50; 95\% CI, 1.73\textendash 3.62; P{$<$}0.0001). Untreated hypertension was a substantially greater risk factor for all 3 racial/ethnic groups across all locations of ICH: whites (OR, 8.79; 95\% CI, 5.66\textendash 13.66; P{$<$}0.0001), blacks (OR, 12.46; 95\% CI, 8.08\textendash 19.20; P{$<$}0.0001), and Hispanics (OR, 10.95; 95\% CI, 6.58\textendash 18.23; P{$<$}0.0001). There was an interaction between race/ethnicity and ICH risk (P{$<$}0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Untreated hypertension confers a greater ICH risk in blacks and Hispanics relative to whites across all anatomic locations of ICH. Accelerated research efforts are needed to improve overall hypertension treatment rates and to monitor the impact of such efforts on racial/ethnic disparities in stroke.},

In a recent meta-analysis, McDowell and Jacobs (2017) showed that presenting a task in natural frequency format increases performance rates to 24\% compared to only 4\% when the same task is presented in probability format. Nevertheless, on average three quarters of participants in their meta-analysis failed to obtain the correct solution for such a task in frequency format. In this paper, we present an empirical study on what participants typically do wrong when confronted with natural frequencies. We found that many of them did not actually use natural frequencies for their calculations, but translated them back into complicated probabilities instead. This switch from the intuitive presentation format to a less intuitive calculation format will be discussed within the framework of psychological theories (e.g., the Einstellung effect).},

These policies encourage authors to avoid bar graphs and use graphics that show the data distribution; however, they provide little guidance on how to effectively display data. We conducted a systematic review of studies published in top peripheral vascular disease journals to determine what types of figures are used, and to assess the prevalence of suboptimal data visualization practices. Among papers with data figures, 47.7\% of papers used bar graphs to present continuous data. This primer provides a detailed overview of strategies for addressing this issue by (1) outlining strategies for selecting the correct type of figure depending on the study design, sample size, and the type of variable; (2) examining techniques for making effective dot plots, box plots, and violin plots; and (3) illustrating how to avoid sending mixed messages by aligning the figure structure with the study design and statistical analysis. We also present solutions to other common problems identified in the systematic review. Resources include a list of free tools and templates that authors can use to create more informative figures and an online simulator that illustrates why summary statistics are meaningful only when there are enough data to summarize. Last, we consider steps that investigators can take to improve figures in the scientific literature.},

Since the publication of the original guideline, several authorities have recognized that improvements in the processes of care, ICU structure, and the use of quality improvement science methodologies can beneficially impact patient outcomes and reduce costs. Herein, we summarize findings of the American College of Critical Care Medicine Task Force on Models of Critical Care: 1) An intensivist-led, high-performing, multidisciplinary team dedicated to the ICU is an integral part of effective care delivery; 2) Process improvement is the backbone of achieving high-quality ICU outcomes; 3) Standardized protocols including care bundles and order sets to facilitate measurable processes and outcomes should be used and further developed in the ICU setting; and 4) Institutional support for comprehensive quality improvement programs as well as tele-ICU programs should be provided.}

Practical management includes effective screening, early identification and appropriate treatment aimed at minimising complications and timely escalation decisions.

  abstract = {Coma trajectories are characterized by quick awakening or protracted awakening. Outcome is bookended by restored functionality or permanent cognitively and physically debilitated states. Given the stakes, prognostication cannot be easily questioned as a judgment call, and a scientific underpinning is elemental. Conventional wisdom in determining coma-outcome trajectories posits that (1) predictive models are better than personal experiences, (2) self-fulfilling prophesy is unchecked and driven by nihilism, with little regard for prior probability outcomes, and (3) recovery is impacted by patients' prior wishes and preexisting medical conditions\textemdash but also by what families are told about the patient's state and anticipated clinical course. Moreover, a predicted good outcome can be offset by a major subsequent complication, or a predicted poor outcome can be offset by aggressive care. This article examines some of these concepts, including how we decide on aggressiveness of care, how we judge quality of life, and the impact on outcome. Most patients who awaken quickly do well and can resume their pretrauma injury lives. In worse off, slowto-awaken patients, outcomes are a mixed bag of limited innate resilience, depleted cognitive and physical reserves, and adjusted quality of life. Bias and noise are factors not easily measured in outcome prediction, but their influence on recovery trajectories raises some troubling issues.},

  abstract = {Globally, approximately 70 million people sustain traumatic brain injury each year and this can have significant physical, psychosocial and economic consequences for patients, their families and society. The aim of this review is to provide clinicians with a summary of recent studies of direct relevance to the management of traumatic brain injury in order to promote best clinical practice. The use of tranexamic acid in the management of traumatic brain injury has been the focus of several studies, with one large randomised controlled trial suggesting a reduction in all-cause mortality within 24 h of injury. The use of therapeutic hypothermia does not improve neurological outcomes and maintenance of normothermia remains the optimal management strategy. For seizure management, levetiracetam appears to be as effective as phenytoin, but the optimal dose remains unclear. There has been a lack of clear outcome benefit for any individual osmotherapy agent, with no difference in mortality or neurological recovery. Early tracheostomy ({$<$} 7 days from injury) for patients with traumatic brain injury is associated with a reduction in the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia and duration of mechanical ventilation, critical care and hospital stay. Further research is needed in order to determine the optimal package of care and interventions. There is a need for research studies to focus on patient-centred outcome measures such as long-term neurological recovery and quality of life.},

  abstract = {Herein, we review mechanisms regulating cerebral blood flow (CBF), with specific focus on humans. We revisit important concepts from the older literature and describe the interaction of various mechanisms of cerebrovascular control. We amalgamate this broad scope of information into a brief review, rather than detailing any one mechanism or area of research. The relationship between regulatory mechanisms is emphasized, but the following three broad categories of control are explicated: (1) the effect of blood gases and neuronal metabolism on CBF; (2) buffering of CBF with changes in blood pressure, termed cerebral autoregulation; and (3) the role of the autonomic nervous system in CBF regulation. With respect to these control mechanisms, we provide evidence against several canonized paradigms of CBF control. Specifically, we corroborate the following four key theses: (1) that cerebral autoregulation does not maintain constant perfusion through a mean arterial pressure range of 60\textendash 150 mmHg; (2) that there is important stimulatory synergism and regulatory interdependence of arterial blood gases and blood pressure on CBF regulation; (3) that cerebral autoregulation and cerebrovascular sensitivity to changes in arterial blood gases are not modulated solely at the pial arterioles; and (4) that neurogenic control of the cerebral vasculature is an important player in autoregulatory function and, crucially, acts to buffer surges in perfusion pressure. Finally, we summarize the state of our knowledge with respect to these areas, outline important gaps in the literature and suggest avenues for future research.},

Many patients fall clearly into a particular category; however, patients may have outcomes that are on the borderline between adjacent categories, and cases can present other challenges for assessment. The Manual includes the general principles of assessment, advice on administering each section of the GOSE interview, and guidance on ``borderline'' and ``difficult'' cases.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: ICU patients/surrogates may experience adverse outcomes related to perceived inappropriate treatment. The objective was to determine the prevalence of patient/surrogatereported perceived inappropriate treatment, its impact on adverse outcomes, and discordance with clinicians. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, prospective, observational study of adult ICU patients. RESULTS: For 151 patients, 1,332 patient, surrogate, nurse, and physician surveys were collected. Disagreement between patients/surrogates and clinicians regarding ``too much'' treatment being administered occurred in 26\% of patients. Disagreement regarding ``too little'' treatment occurred in 10\% of patients. Disagreement about perceived inappropriate treatment was associated with prognostic discordance (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .02) and lower patient/surrogate satisfaction (Likert scale 1-5 of 4 vs 5; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .02). Patient/surrogate respondents reported ``too much'' treatment in 8\% of patients and ``too little'' treatment in 6\% of patients. Perceived inappropriate treatment was associated with moderate or high respondent distress for 55\% of patient/surrogate respondents and 35\% of physician/nurse respondents (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .30). Patient/surrogate perception of inappropriate treatment was associated with lower satisfaction (Family Satisfaction in the ICU Questionnaire-24, 69.9 vs 86.6; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .002) and lower trust in the clinical team (Likert scale 1-5 of 4 vs 5; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .007), but no statistically significant differences in depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-2 of 2 vs 1; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .06) or anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale of 7 vs 4; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .18). CONCLUSIONS: For approximately one-third of ICU patients, there is disagreement between clinicians and patients/surrogates about the appropriateness of treatment. Disagreement about appropriateness of treatment was associated with prognostic discordance and lower patient/surrogate satisfaction. Patients/surrogates who reported inappropriate treatment also reported lower satisfaction and trust in the ICU team. CHEST 2019; 155(6):1140-1147},

Methods               To provide further details about design and development methods, we summarized findings from a subgroup ( n = 283 patient decision aid projects) in a recent systematic review of user involvement by Vaisson et al. Using a new measure of user-centeredness (UCD-11), we then rated the degree of user-centeredness reported in 66 articles describing patient decision aid development and citing the 2013 IPDAS update on systematic development. We contacted the 66 articles' authors to request their self-reports of UCD-11 items.                                         Results               The 283 development processes varied substantially from minimal iteration cycles to more complex processes, with multiple iterations, needs assessments, and extensive involvement of end users. We summarized minimal, medium, and maximal processes from the data. Authors of 54 of 66 articles (82\%) provided self-reported UCD-11 ratings. Self-reported scores were significantly higher than reviewer ratings (reviewers: mean [SD] = 6.45 [3.10]; authors: mean [SD] = 9.62 [1.16], P {$<$} 0.001).                                         Conclusions               Decision aid developers have embraced principles of user-centered design in the development of patient decision aids while also underreporting aspects of user involvement in publications about their tools. Templates may reduce the need for extensive development, and new approaches for rapid development of aids have been proposed when a more detailed approach is not feasible. We provide empirically derived benchmark processes and a reporting checklist to support developers in more fully describing their development processes. [Box: see text]},

In 2012 Thomas Woodcock and his son proposed that experience and experimental observations surrounding clinical practices involving the administration of intravenous fluids were better explained by the revised Starling principle. In particular, the revised or extended Starling principle can explain why crystalloid resuscitation from the abrupt physiologic insult of hypovolaemia is much more effective than the pre-revision Starling principle had led clinicians to expect. The authors of this chapter have since combined their science and clinical expertise to offer clinicians a better basis for their practice of rational fluid therapy.},

Fluid therapy to support the circulation relies on applying a physiological paradigm that better explains clinical and research observations. The revised Starling equation based on recent research considers the contributions of the endothelial glycocalyx layer (EGL), the endothelial basement membrane, and the extracellular matrix. The characteristics of capillaries in various tissues are reviewed and some clinical corollaries considered. The oncotic pressure difference across the EGL opposes, but does not reverse, the filtration rate (the `no absorption' rule) and is an important feature of the revised paradigm and highlights the limitations of attempting to prevent or treat oedema by transfusing colloids. Filtered fluid returns to the circulation as lymph. The EGL excludes larger molecules and occupies a substantial volume of the intravascular space and therefore requires a new interpretation of dilution studies of blood volume and the speculation that protection or restoration of the EGL might be an important therapeutic goal. An explanation for the phenomenon of context sensitivity of fluid volume kinetics is offered, and the proposal that crystalloid resuscitation from low capillary pressures is rational. Any potential advantage of plasma or plasma substitutes over crystalloids for volume expansion only manifests itself at higher capillary pressures.},

DESIGN: Secondary, subgroup analysis of a cohort study. SETTING: Single, 36-bed mixed medical-surgical ICU in the Netherlands from July 2016 to February 2020. PATIENTS: Consecutive adults were included. Patients admitted after elective surgery, not expected to survive greater than or equal to 48 hours, admitted with delirium, or where delirium occurred prior to ketamine use were excluded. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Trained ICU nurses evaluated patients without coma (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale. \textendash 4/\textendash 5) every 8 hours with the Confusion Assessment Method ICU; a delirium day was defined by greater than or equal to1 + Confusion Assessment Method ICU and/or scheduled antipsychotic use. Among 11 variables compared between the delirium and nondelirium groups (Baseline: age, Charlson Comorbidity score, cognitive impairment, admission type, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-IV score, daily ICU [until delirium occurrence or discharge]: Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, coma, benzodiazepine, opioid, and ketamine use) and total ICU days, 7 (age, Charlson score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, coma, benzodiazepine, opioid, and ketamine use) were significantly different and were entered, along with delirium occurrence, in a logistic regression model. A total of 332 of 925 of patients (36\%) developed delirium. Ketamine use was greater in patients with delirium (54 [16\%] vs 4 [0.7\%]; p {$<$} 0.01). Ketamine use (adjusted odds ratio, 5.60; 95\% CI, 1.09\textendash 29.15), age (adjusted odds ratio, 1.03; 95\% CI, 1.01\textendash 1.06), coma (adjusted odds ratio, 2.10; 95\% CI, 1.15\textendash 3.78), opioid use (adjusted odds ratio, 171.17; 95\% CI, 66.45\textendash 553.68), and benzodiazepine use (adjusted odds ratio, 34.07; 95\% CI, 8.12\textendash 235.34) were each independently and significantly associated with increased delirium. Delirium duration, motoric subtype, delirium treatments, and outcomes were not different between the ketamine and nonketamine groups. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine analgosedation may contribute to increased ICU delirium. The characteristics of ketamine and nonketamine delirium are similar. Further prospective research is required to evaluate the magnitude of risk for delirium with ketamine use.},

We assessed the effects of the influenza vaccine on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library through January 2020 for randomized controlled trials and observational studies assessing the effects of influenza vaccine on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. Estimates were reported as random effects risk ratios (RRs) with 95\% CIs. Analyses were stratified by study design into randomized controlled trials and observational studies. A total of 16 studies (n=237 058), including 4 randomized controlled trials (n=1667) and 12 observational studies (n=235 391), were identified. Participants' mean age was 69.2{$\pm$}7.01 years, 36.6\% were women, 65.1\% had hypertension, 31.1\% had diabetes mellitus, and 23.4\% were smokers. At a median follow-\-up duration of 19.5 months, influenza vaccine was associated with a lower risk of all-\-cause mortality (RR, 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.60\textendash\-0.93 [P=0.01]), cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.80\textendash\-0.84 [P{$<$}0.001]), and major adverse cardiovascular events (RR, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.80\textendash\-0.94 [P{$<$}0.001]) compared with control. The use of the influenza vaccine was not associated with a statistically significant reduction of myocardial infarction (RR, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.49\textendash\-1.09 [P=0.12]) compared with control. CONCLUSIONS: Data from both randomized controlled trials and observational studies support the use of the influenza vaccine in adults with cardiovascular disease to reduce mortality and cardiovascular events, as currently supported by clinical guidelines. Clinicians and health systems should continue to promote the influenza vaccine as part of comprehensive secondary prevention.},

Multidisciplinary management, early recognition of potential complications, specialised care of medications and intra-operative protection of the vulnerable brain are all important aspects of the peri-operative management of patients with Parkinson's disease. Advances in continuous dopaminergic treatment, development of a peri-operative Parkinson's disease pathway and application of telemedicine are starting to play a role in improving peri-operative care. Management of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease is also evolving, with potential for incorporation of integrated care and changes in the anaesthetic management for deep brain stimulation surgery. There are new methods for localisation of target nuclei and increasing insight on the effects of anaesthetic drugs on microelectrode recordings and clinical outcomes. Parkinson's disease is a progressive disease, but management is improving with better perioperative care for patients.},

  abstract = {Objective Hematoma expansion (HE) is commonly analyzed as a dichotomous outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) trials. In this proof-of-concept study, we propose an HE shift analysis model as a method to improve the evaluation of candidate ICH therapies. Methods Using data from the Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage II (ATACH2) trial, we performed HE shift analysis in response to intensive blood pressure lowering by generating polychotomous strata based on previously established HE definitions, percentile/ absolute quartiles of hematoma volume change, and quartiles of 24-hour follow-up hematoma volumes. The relationship between blood pressure treatment and HE shift was explored with proportional odds models. Results The primary analysis population included 863 patients. In both treatment groups, approximately one-third of patients exhibited no HE. With the use of a trichotomous HE stratification, the highest strata of {$\geq$}33\% revealed a 5.8\% reduction in hematoma growth for those randomized to intensive therapy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.77, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.60\textendash 0.99). Using percentile quartiles of hematoma volume change, we observed a favorable shift to reduce growth in patients treated with intensive therapy (aOR 0.73, 95\% CI 0.57\textendash 0.93). Similarly, in a tetrachotomous analysis of 24-hour follow-up hematoma volumes, shifts in the highest stratum ({$>$}21.9 mL) were most notable. Conclusions Our findings suggest that intensive blood pressure reduction may preferentially mitigate growth in patients at risk of high volume HE. A shift analysis model of HE provides additional insights into the biological effects of a given therapy and may be an additional way to assess hemostatic agents in future studies.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Neuroethical questions raised by recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of consciousness are rapidly expanding, increasingly relevant, and yet underexplored. The aim of this thematic review is to provide a clinically applicable framework for understanding the current taxonomy of disorders of consciousness and to propose an approach to identifying and critically evaluating actionable neuroethical issues that are frequently encountered in research and clinical care for this vulnerable population. Increased awareness of these issues and clarity about opportunities for optimizing ethically-responsible care in this domain are especially timely given recent surges in critically ill patients with unusually prolonged disorders of consciousness associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) around the world. We begin with an overview of the field of neuroethics: what it is, its history and evolution in the context of biomedical ethics at large. We then explore nomenclature used in disorders of consciousness, covering categories proposed by the American Academy of Neurology, the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine, and the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research, including definitions of terms such as coma, the vegetative state, unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, minimally conscious state, covert consciousness, and the confusional state. We discuss why these definitions matter, and why there has been such evolution in this nosology over the years, from Jennett and Plum in 1972 to the Multi-Society Task Force in 1994, the Aspen Working Group in 2002 and up until the 2018 American and 2020 European Disorders of Consciousness guidelines. We then move to a discussion of clinical aspects of disorders of consciousness, the natural history of recovery, and ethical issues that arise within the context of caring for persons with disorders of consciousness. We conclude with a discussion of key challenges associated with assessing residual consciousness in disorders of consciousness, potential solutions and future directions, including integration of crucial disability rights perspectives.},

It is biologically plausible that the dose of oxygen used might affect important patient outcomes. Most peri-operative research has focussed on oxygen regimens that target higher than normal blood oxygen levels. Whereas, intensive care research has mostly focussed on conservative oxygen regimens which assiduously avoid exposure to higher than normal blood oxygen levels. While such conservative oxygen therapy is preferred for spontaneously breathing patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the optimal oxygen regimen in other patient groups is not clear. Some data suggest that conservative oxygen therapy might be preferred for patients with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy. However, unless oxygen supplies are constrained, routinely aggressively down-titrating oxygen in either the peri-operative or intensive care setting is not necessary based on available data. Targeting higher than normal levels of oxygen might reduce surgical site infections in the perioperative setting and/or improve outcomes for intensive care patients with sepsis but further research is required and available data are not sufficiently strong to warrant routine implementation of such oxygen strategies.},

Five randomized controlled trials were selected for analysis. Although rFVIIa can reduce the change in ICH volume, there was no significant difference in mortality, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score or extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) score in patients treated with rFVIIa or placebo. There was a significant increase in arterial thromboembolic adverse events (TAE) in patients treated with rFVIIa. There was an increase in deep vein thrombosis in patients with spontaneous ICH and traumatic ICH.

RESULTS In 1935 patients with mTBI (mean [SD] age, 41.5 [17.6] years; 1286 men [66.5\%]) in the TRACK-TBI cohort and 2594 patients with mTBI (mean [SD] age, 51.8 [20.3] years; 1658 men [63.9\%]) in an external validation cohort, hierarchical cluster analysis identified 3 major clusters of CT features: contusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and/or subdural hematoma; intraventricular and/or petechial hemorrhage; and epidural hematoma. Contusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and/or subdural hematoma features were associated with incomplete recovery (odds ratios [ORs] for GOSE scores {$<$}8 at 1 year: TRACK-TBI, 1.80 [95\% CI, 1.39-2.33]; CENTER-TBI, 2.73 [95\% CI, 2.18-3.41]) and greater degrees of unfavorable outcomes (ORs for GOSE scores {$<$}5 at 1 year: TRACK-TBI, 3.23 [95\% CI, 1.59-6.58]; CENTER-TBI, 1.68 [95\% CI, 1.13-2.49]) out to 12 months after injury, but epidural hematoma was not. Intraventricular and/or petechial hemorrhage was associated with greater degrees of unfavorable outcomes up to 12 months after injury (eg, OR for GOSE scores {$<$}5 at 1 year in TRACK-TBI: 3.47 [95\% CI, 1.66-7.26]). Some CT features were more strongly associated with outcomes than previously validated variables (eg, ORs for GOSE scores {$<$}5 at 1 year in TRACK-TBI: neuropsychiatric history, 1.43 [95\% CI .98-2.10] vs contusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and/or subdural hematoma, 3.23 [95\% CI 1.59-6.58]). Findings were externally validated in 2594 patients with mTBI enrolled in the CENTER-TBI study. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, pathological CT features carried different prognostic implications after mTBI to 1 year postinjury. Some patterns of injury were associated with worse outcomes than others. These results support that patients with mTBI and these CT features need TBI-specific education and systematic follow-up.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) with electroencephalographic epileptiform activity (seizures, periodic and rhythmic patterns, and sporadic discharges) are frequently treated with antiseizure medications (ASMs). However, the safety and effectiveness of ASM treatment for epileptiform activity has not been established. We used observational data to investigate the effectiveness of ASM treatment in patients with aSAH undergoing continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) to develop a causal hypothesis for testing in prospective trials. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} This was a retrospective single-center cohort study of patients with aSAH admitted between 2011 and 2016. Patients underwent\,{$\geq$}\,24 h of cEEG within 4 days of admission. All patients received primary ASM prophylaxis until aneurysm treatment (typically within 24 h of admission). Treatment exposure was defined as reinitiation of ASMs after aneurysm treatment and cEEG initiation. We excluded patients with non-cEEG indications for ASMs (e.g., epilepsy, acute symptomatic seizures). Outcomes measures were 90-day mortality and good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale scores 0\textendash 3). Propensity scores were used to adjust for baseline covariates and disease severity. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Ninety-four patients were eligible (40 continued ASM treatment; 54 received prophylaxis only). ASM continuation was not significantly associated with higher 90-day mortality (propensity-adjusted hazard ratio [HR]\,=\,2.01 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.57\textendash 7.02]). ASM continuation was associated with lower likelihood for 90-day good functional outcome (propensity-adjusted HR\,=\,0.39 [95\% CI 0.18\textendash 0.81]). In a secondary analysis, low-intensity treatment (low-dose single ASM) was not significantly associated with mortality (propensity-adjusted HR\,=\,0.60 [95\% CI 0.10\textendash 3.59]), although it was associated with a lower likelihood of good outcome (propensity-adjusted HR\,=\,0.37 [95\% CI 0.15\textendash 0.91]), compared with prophylaxis. High-intensity treatment (high-dose single ASM, multiple ASMs, or anesthetics) was associated with higher mortality (propensity-adjusted HR\,=\,6.80 [95\% CI 1.67\textendash 27.65]) and lower likelihood for good outcomes (propensity-adjusted HR\,=\,0.30 [95\% CI 0.10\textendash 0.94]) compared with prophylaxis only.},

With advances in information technology and availability of electronic healthcare record, scoring systems of less commonly seen diseases and population can be developed. The aim of the article is to provide a tutorial on how to develop and validate risk scores based on a virtual dataset by using R software. The dataset we generated including numeric and categorical variables and firstly the numeric variables would be converted to factor variables according to cutoff points identified by the LOESS smoother. Then risk points of each variable, which are related to the coefficients in logistic regression, are assigned to each level of the converted factor variables and other categorical variables. Finally, the total score is calculated for each subject to represent the prediction of the outcome event probability. The original dataset is split into training and validation subsets. Discrimination and calibration are evaluated in the validation subset. R codes with explanations are presented in the main text.}

  abstract = {Background: The U.S. lacks a stroke surveillance system. This study develops a method to transform an existing registry into a nationally representative database to evaluate acute ischemic stroke care quality. Methods: Two statistical approaches are used to develop post-stratification weights for the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke registry by anchoring population estimates to the National Inpatient Sample. Post-stratification survey weights are estimated using a raking procedure and Bayesian interpolation methods. Weighting methods are adjusted to limit the dispersion of weights and make reasonable epidemiologic estimates of patient characteristics, quality of hospital care, and clinical outcomes. Standardized differences in national estimates are reported between the two post-stratification methods for anchored and non-anchored patient characteristics to evaluate estimation quality. Primary measures evaluated are patient and hospital characteristics, stroke severity, vital and laboratory measures, disposition, and clinical outcomes at discharge. Results: A total of 1,388,296 acute ischemic strokes occurred between 2012 and 2014. Raking and Bayesian estimates of clinical data not available in administrative data are estimated within 5 to 10\% of margin for expected values. Median weight for the raking method is 1.386 and the weights at the 99th percentile is 6.881 with a maximum weight of 30.775. Median Bayesian weight is 1.329 and the 99th percentile weights is 11.201 with a maximum weight of 515.689. Conclusions: Leveraging existing databases with patient registries to develop post-stratification weights is a reliable approach to estimate acute ischemic stroke epidemiology and monitoring for stroke quality of care nationally. These methods may be applied to other diseases or settings to better monitor population health.},
